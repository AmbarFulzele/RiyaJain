It was the lowest since March 2009, when the reading was below 50, indicating contraction. September's index also recorded the biggest one-month fall since November 2008. <br>The sub-index for new orders, which reflects future output, declined for the sixth successive month, while export orders fell for a third month on the back of weakness in global economy. <br>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) last week indicated it was not done yet with monetary policy tightening as inflation was still high. The bank has already raised rates 12 times since March 2010 to tame inflation, which is at a 13-month high of 9.78%. <br><br>Economists expect the RBI to raise rates one more time but warn that targeted growth will be hard to achieve if the slump continues. "This (fall in PMI) was driven by weaker orders, with export orders still contracting due to the weaker global economic conditions," HSBC said in a press release quoting its chief economist for India &amp; ASEAN. PMI is considered a fairly good indicator of manufacturing activity the world over, but in the case of India, the large contribution of the unorganised sector yields a low correlation with industrial growth. However, the Index for Industrial Production (IIP) has been showing a weakening tend, having slipped to a 21 month low of 3.3% in July. The core sector, which consists of eight infrastructure industries and has a combined weight of 37.9% in the IIP, also grew at only 3.5% in August. <br><br>The PMI data is in line with the suffering manufacturing activity in India as per other estimates. Producers are seeing that demand conditions are softening and the outlook is uncertain, therefore they are producing less.

It was the lowest since March 2009, when the reading was below 50, indicating contraction. September's index also recorded the biggest one-month fall since November 2008. <br>The sub-index for new orders, which reflects future output, declined for the sixth successive month, while export orders fell for a third month on the back of weakness in global economy. <br>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) last week indicated it was not done yet with monetary policy tightening as inflation was still high. The bank has already raised rates 12 times since March 2010 to tame inflation, which is at a 13-month high of 9.78%. <br><br>Economists expect the RBI to raise rates one more time but warn that targeted growth will be hard to achieve if the slump continues. "This (fall in PMI) was driven by weaker orders, with export orders still contracting due to the weaker global economic conditions," HSBC said in a press release quoting its chief economist for India &amp; ASEAN. PMI is considered a fairly good indicator of manufacturing activity the world over, but in the case of India, the large contribution of the unorganised sector yields a low correlation with industrial growth. However, the Index for Industrial Production (IIP) has been showing a weakening tend, having slipped to a 21 month low of 3.3% in July. The core sector, which consists of eight infrastructure industries and has a combined weight of 37.9% in the IIP, also grew at only 3.5% in August. <br><br>The PMI data is in line with the suffering manufacturing activity in India as per other estimates. Producers are seeing that demand conditions are softening and the outlook is uncertain, therefore they are producing less. Employment in the manufacturing sector declined for the second consecutive month, indicating it too was under pressure. This could be attributed to lower requirement of staff and rise in resignations as higher wage requests go unfulfilled, the HSBC statement said. <br><br>On the inflation front, input prices rose at an 11-month low rate, but despite signs of softening, they still remain at historically high levels. <br>While decelerating slightly, the readings for input and output prices suggest that inflation pressures remain firmly in place. <br>Most economists feel the RBI is close to the end of its rate hike cycle.

It was the lowest since March 2009, when the reading was below 50, indicating contraction. September's index also recorded the biggest one-month fall since November 2008. <br>The sub-index for new orders, which reflects future output, declined for the sixth successive month, while export orders fell for a third month on the back of weakness in global economy. <br>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) last week indicated it was not done yet with monetary policy tightening as inflation was still high. The bank has already raised rates 12 times since March 2010 to tame inflation, which is at a 13-month high of 9.78%. <br><br>Economists expect the RBI to raise rates one more time but warn that targeted growth will be hard to achieve if the slump continues. "This (fall in PMI) was driven by weaker orders, with export orders still contracting due to the weaker global economic conditions," HSBC said in a press release quoting its chief economist for India &amp; ASEAN. PMI is considered a fairly good indicator of manufacturing activity the world over, but in the case of India, the large contribution of the unorganised sector yields a low correlation with industrial growth. However, the Index for Industrial Production (IIP) has been showing a weakening tend, having slipped to a 21 month low of 3.3% in July. The core sector, which consists of eight infrastructure industries and has a combined weight of 37.9% in the IIP, also grew at only 3.5% in August. <br><br>The PMI data is in line with the suffering manufacturing activity in India as per other estimates. Producers are seeing that demand conditions are softening and the outlook is uncertain, therefore they are producing less. Employment in the manufacturing sector declined for the second consecutive month, indicating it too was under pressure. This could be attributed to lower requirement of staff and rise in resignations as higher wage requests go unfulfilled, the HSBC statement said. <br><br>On the inflation front, input prices rose at an 11-month low rate, but despite signs of softening, they still remain at historically high levels. <br>While decelerating slightly, the readings for input and output prices suggest that inflation pressures remain firmly in place. <br>Most economists feel the RBI is close to the end of its rate hike cycle. Even the weekly Wholesale Price Index (WPI) estimates have started showing signs of softening, having fallen more than one percentage point.</div></div><div id="Language_Skills" class="question-details-Language-skill"><b>Type:&nbsp;</b> MCQ Single &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Marks:&nbsp;</b>  +1/-0 &nbsp;&nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Topic:&nbsp;</b> Verbal &gt; Reading Comprehension  &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Time Spent:&nbsp;</b><div>0 Mins 0 Secs</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-paper-number">24.&nbsp; </div> <div class="question-paper-question-text">Which of the following is indicated as one of the reasons for the fall in PMI?</div></div><div class="question-paper-options"><div class="question-paper-option">A.&nbsp;Less number of orders were placed</div><div class="question-paper-option">B.&nbsp;Unorganised sector failed to give the required results</div><div class="question-paper-option">C.&nbsp; Industrial unrest reduced manufacturing</div><div class="question-paper-option">D.&nbsp;RBI has stopped raising the rates</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-status-solution">Status : &nbsp;<div class="unanswered-answer">Unanswered</div></div></div><div class="question-paper-text-actual-solution"><b>Answer :  A</b></div><div class="solution"><div data-accordion-component="Accordion" class="accordion"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItem" class="accordion__item"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemHeading" role="heading" class="accordion__heading" aria-level="3"><div id="accordion__heading-23" aria-disabled="false" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accordion__panel-23" role="button" tabindex="0" class="accordion__button" data-accordion-component="AccordionItemButton">View Solution</div></div><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemPanel" class="accordion__panel" role="region" aria-labelledby="accordion__heading-23" id="accordion__panel-23" hidden="">Refer to the line, “This (fall in PMI) was driven by weaker orders,…global economic conditions…”</div></div></div></div><div class="bookmark-question"><button class="bookmark-button Button__StyledButton-sc-1o41kgk-0 hHWAHx" spacing="default" type="button"><span style="align-self: center; display: inline-flex; flex-wrap: nowrap; max-width: 100%; position: relative;"><span style="align-items: center; align-self: center; flex: 1 1 auto; margin: 0px 4px; max-width: 100%; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; transition: opacity 0.3s ease 0s; opacity: 1;"><span class="sc-iQKALj jOPeQg"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation"><path d="M12 16.373l3.98 2.193-.76-4.655 3.276-3.347-4.524-.69L12 5.687l-1.972 4.189-4.524.689L8.78 13.91l-.762 4.655L12 16.373zm0 2.283l-3.016 1.662a2 2 0 0 1-2.939-2.075l.599-3.656-2.57-2.624a2 2 0 0 1 1.129-3.377l3.47-.528 1.518-3.224a2 2 0 0 1 3.618 0l1.519 3.224 3.47.528a2 2 0 0 1 1.127 3.377l-2.569 2.624.599 3.656a2 2 0 0 1-2.94 2.075L12 18.656z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></span>Bookmark</span></span></button><button class="bookmark-button Button__StyledButton-sc-1o41kgk-0 hHWAHx" spacing="default" type="button"><span style="align-self: center; display: inline-flex; flex-wrap: nowrap; max-width: 100%; position: relative;"><span style="align-items: center; align-self: center; flex: 1 1 auto; margin: 0px 4px; max-width: 100%; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; transition: opacity 0.3s ease 0s; opacity: 1;"><span class="sc-iQKALj jOPeQg"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation"><path d="M6 12.235v6.446c0 .537.45.977 1 .977s1-.44 1-.977v-5.778c1.17-.341 2.389-.045 3.768.29.982.238 2.036.495 3.13.495a5.73 5.73 0 0 0 2.547-.567 1 1 0 0 0 .563-.9V5.466a.998.998 0 0 0-1.437-.9c-1.345.654-2.731.317-4.331-.071-1.729-.42-3.687-.895-5.678.072A1 1 0 0 0 6 5.466v6.769zm3.111-1.48c1.094 0 2.148.256 3.129.495 1.381.335 2.6.63 3.768.289V6.836c-1.488.27-2.93-.08-4.24-.398-1.379-.335-2.598-.632-3.768-.29v4.704a6.195 6.195 0 0 1 1.111-.097z" fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></span> Share question feedback</span></span></button></div><hr></div><div class="question-div-paper"><div class="passage-details"><div class="passage-header"><b> Passage :</b></div><div class="passage-header">Read the following passage to answer the questions based on it. Some words/phrases are given in bold to help you locate them while answering some of the questions. <br><br>Indian banks' pile of bad loans is a huge drag on the economy. It's a drain on banks' profits. Because profits are eroded, public sector banks (PSBs), where the bulk of the bad loans reside, cannot raise enough capital to fund credit growth. Lack of credit growth, in turn, comes in the way of the economy's return to an 8 per cent growth trajectory. Clearly, the bad loan problem requires effective resolution. <br><br>A proposal floated a few years ago is doing the rounds again, namely, the creation of a 'bad bank' that would house the bad loans in the PSB system. The proposal has its merits. However, making a success of it in the Indian context poses significant challenges. Before we examine the proposal, it's best to have an idea of how banks deal with bad loans. Once an asset is recognised as a non-performing asset (NPA), banks must decide what to do with it. They have several options. One, they can try to seize the assets pledged by the borrower and sell these. This typically involves large losses on loans as the assets have to be sold at steep discounts to their book value. <br><br>Two, under the RBI's Strategic Debt Restructuring (SDR) scheme, they can convert their loans into equity, acquire a majority stake in the firm, dislodge the promoters or management and bring in new promoters and management. While this happens in advanced economies all the time, the SDR scheme has not taken off in India. Indian banks do not have experience in running businesses till such time as new promoters are found. Nor do they have experience in locating promoters and management who can take over the stressed assets. <br><br>Three, banks can restructure the loans so that borrowers are able to service them. This involves stretching out the period of payment, or <strong>waiving </strong>a portion of the loans, or reducing the interest rate on loans, or some combination of these. In any restructuring, banks <strong>incur </strong>losses on the loans they have made. At PSBs, managers are open to the charge that they have favoured borrowers in a restructuring scheme and can invite action from the investigative agencies. In today's environment, this has resulted in virtual paralysis at PSBs. <br><br>A fourth option for banks is to sell the NPA at a discount to an Asset Restructuring Company. This again involves a significant loss on loans when the transaction is made. But it has the effect of getting an NPA off the books of the bank or 'cleaning up the balance sheet'. The bank's capital is eroded to the extent of the loss. However, since 100 per cent of the loan has exited the balance sheet, the ratio of regulatory capital to assets — or what is called 'capital adequacy'— improves. The bank now looks more attractive to investors. <br><br>The bad bank proposal is a variant of the fourth option. The idea is to transfer NPAs of banks, perhaps only PSBs, to the bad bank. The bad bank will manage these NPAs in suitable ways — some may be liquidated, others may be restructured, etc. Getting NPAs off the books will help the PSB management focus on new business instead of having to expend their energies on trying to effect recoveries. A bad bank will be better focused on the task of recovery. If it's a private entity, it can also bring in superior expertise. It would appear that the bad bank concept has many things going for it. <br><br>Alas, the devil, as always, is in the detail. First, who will have the majority stake in the bad bank? Will it be the government or private investors? Let us suppose it's the former. Given the size of NPAs at PSBs, the capital required by a bad bank for acquiring NPAs will be substantial. If the government is to be the majority owner, how does it find the required funds? Second, a government-owned bad bank will be subject to the same constraints in managing bad loans as PSBs. Third, managing the sheer size and diversity of bad loans acquired from multiple PSBs will be a tall order. Last, a government entity may not be able to pay specialists what it takes. Whichever way you look at it, a government-owned bad bank appears to be transferring the problem from one part of the government to another. <br><br>Now consider the second possibility, namely, that private investors have a majority stake in the bad bank. These could be long-term investors such as sovereign wealth funds and pension funds. In this case, the price at which PSB loans are sold to the bad bank could become a major issue. If the price is too high, the bad bank will not be <strong>viable</strong>. If it's too low, PSBs will be accused of selling their loans too cheaply to private investors — we will have the makings of an 'NPA scam'. <br><br>There are other issues with transferring NPAs to a bad bank. As former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan pointed out, a big chunk of NPAs at PSBs pertains to projects that are viable. These projects have not gone through to completion for reasons that are mostly extraneous to the project, such as problems in land acquisition or environmental clearance. With restructuring and additional funding, they can be completed and would create significant capacities. Selling these loans to a bad bank, on the other hand, would be a time-consuming process. It would impede fresh flow of funds into these projects. Their debt would rise as the interest piles up. Mr. Rajan had pointed out that bad banks were typically intended for situations where projects were not viable. They were not meant for a situation such as ours where projects are viable. <br><br>The bad bank idea thus <strong>bristles </strong>with problems. So what could be the motivation for floating it? Well, a big motivation would be to dress up the PSBs by getting rid of their bad loans. Then, private capital can be attracted to them, perhaps through the sale of small stakes to strategic investors. PSBs would also be able to access the equity markets for funds and would not be as dependent on the government for capital. Today's weaker PSBs can be <strong>merged </strong>with the stronger ones. <br><br>Is there a way in which the positives can be realised without creating a bad bank that itself requires too much capital and is too big to manage? One answer may be to set up a bad bank to deal with NPAs at some of the weaker PSBs, instead of one that picks up NPAs from all PSBs. It would prove less controversial if the government had a majority stake in it. Let us see how the experiment goes.</div></div><div id="Language_Skills" class="question-details-Language-skill"><b>Type:&nbsp;</b> MCQ Single &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Marks:&nbsp;</b>  +1/-0 &nbsp;&nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Topic:&nbsp;</b> Verbal &gt; Reading Comprehension  &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Time Spent:&nbsp;</b><div>0 Mins 0 Secs</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-paper-number">25.&nbsp; </div> <div class="question-paper-question-text">What is the effect of bad loans on the public sector banks?</div></div><div class="question-paper-options"><div class="question-paper-option">A.&nbsp;Banks cannot lend money to the government.</div><div class="question-paper-option">B.&nbsp; Banks cannot lend money to the parliament.</div><div class="question-paper-option">C.&nbsp;Banks cannot raise enough capital to fund credit growth.</div><div class="question-paper-option">D.&nbsp; Banks start investing in foreign share markets to recover costs.</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-status-solution">Status : &nbsp;<div class="unanswered-answer">Unanswered</div></div></div><div class="question-paper-text-actual-solution"><b>Answer :  C</b></div><div class="solution"><div data-accordion-component="Accordion" class="accordion"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItem" class="accordion__item"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemHeading" role="heading" class="accordion__heading" aria-level="3"><div id="accordion__heading-24" aria-disabled="false" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accordion__panel-24" role="button" tabindex="0" class="accordion__button" data-accordion-component="AccordionItemButton">View Solution</div></div><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemPanel" class="accordion__panel" role="region" aria-labelledby="accordion__heading-24" id="accordion__panel-24" hidden="">Refer to the second sentence of the first paragraph for the answer.</div></div></div></div><div class="bookmark-question"><button class="bookmark-button Button__StyledButton-sc-1o41kgk-0 hHWAHx" spacing="default" type="button"><span style="align-self: center; display: inline-flex; flex-wrap: nowrap; max-width: 100%; position: relative;"><span style="align-items: center; align-self: center; flex: 1 1 auto; margin: 0px 4px; max-width: 100%; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; transition: opacity 0.3s ease 0s; opacity: 1;"><span class="sc-iQKALj jOPeQg"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation"><path d="M12 16.373l3.98 2.193-.76-4.655 3.276-3.347-4.524-.69L12 5.687l-1.972 4.189-4.524.689L8.78 13.91l-.762 4.655L12 16.373zm0 2.283l-3.016 1.662a2 2 0 0 1-2.939-2.075l.599-3.656-2.57-2.624a2 2 0 0 1 1.129-3.377l3.47-.528 1.518-3.224a2 2 0 0 1 3.618 0l1.519 3.224 3.47.528a2 2 0 0 1 1.127 3.377l-2.569 2.624.599 3.656a2 2 0 0 1-2.94 2.075L12 18.656z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></span>Bookmark</span></span></button><button class="bookmark-button Button__StyledButton-sc-1o41kgk-0 hHWAHx" spacing="default" type="button"><span style="align-self: center; display: inline-flex; flex-wrap: nowrap; max-width: 100%; position: relative;"><span style="align-items: center; align-self: center; flex: 1 1 auto; margin: 0px 4px; max-width: 100%; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; transition: opacity 0.3s ease 0s; opacity: 1;"><span class="sc-iQKALj jOPeQg"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation"><path d="M6 12.235v6.446c0 .537.45.977 1 .977s1-.44 1-.977v-5.778c1.17-.341 2.389-.045 3.768.29.982.238 2.036.495 3.13.495a5.73 5.73 0 0 0 2.547-.567 1 1 0 0 0 .563-.9V5.466a.998.998 0 0 0-1.437-.9c-1.345.654-2.731.317-4.331-.071-1.729-.42-3.687-.895-5.678.072A1 1 0 0 0 6 5.466v6.769zm3.111-1.48c1.094 0 2.148.256 3.129.495 1.381.335 2.6.63 3.768.289V6.836c-1.488.27-2.93-.08-4.24-.398-1.379-.335-2.598-.632-3.768-.29v4.704a6.195 6.195 0 0 1 1.111-.097z" fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></span> Share question feedback</span></span></button></div><hr></div><div class="question-div-paper"><div class="passage-details"><div class="passage-header"><b> Passage :</b></div><div class="passage-header">Read the following passage to answer the questions based on it.

Today's weaker PSBs can be <strong>merged </strong>with the stronger ones. <br><br>Is there a way in which the positives can be realised without creating a bad bank that itself requires too much capital and is too big to manage? One answer may be to set up a bad bank to deal with NPAs at some of the weaker PSBs, instead of one that picks up NPAs from all PSBs. It would prove less controversial if the government had a majority stake in it.

Some words/phrases are given in bold to help you locate them while answering some of the questions. <br><br>Indian banks' pile of bad loans is a huge drag on the economy. It's a drain on banks' profits. Because profits are eroded, public sector banks (PSBs), where the bulk of the bad loans reside, cannot raise enough capital to fund credit growth. Lack of credit growth, in turn, comes in the way of the economy's return to an 8 per cent growth trajectory. Clearly, the bad loan problem requires effective resolution. <br><br>A proposal floated a few years ago is doing the rounds again, namely, the creation of a 'bad bank' that would house the bad loans in the PSB system. The proposal has its merits. However, making a success of it in the Indian context poses significant challenges. Before we examine the proposal, it's best to have an idea of how banks deal with bad loans. Once an asset is recognised as a non-performing asset (NPA), banks must decide what to do with it. They have several options. One, they can try to seize the assets pledged by the borrower and sell these. This typically involves large losses on loans as the assets have to be sold at steep discounts to their book value. <br><br>Two, under the RBI's Strategic Debt Restructuring (SDR) scheme, they can convert their loans into equity, acquire a majority stake in the firm, dislodge the promoters or management and bring in new promoters and management. While this happens in advanced economies all the time, the SDR scheme has not taken off in India. Indian banks do not have experience in running businesses till such time as new promoters are found. Nor do they have experience in locating promoters and management who can take over the stressed assets. <br><br>Three, banks can restructure the loans so that borrowers are able to service them. This involves stretching out the period of payment, or <strong>waiving </strong>a portion of the loans, or reducing the interest rate on loans, or some combination of these. In any restructuring, banks <strong>incur </strong>losses on the loans they have made. At PSBs, managers are open to the charge that they have favoured borrowers in a restructuring scheme and can invite action from the investigative agencies. In today's environment, this has resulted in virtual paralysis at PSBs. <br><br>A fourth option for banks is to sell the NPA at a discount to an Asset Restructuring Company. This again involves a significant loss on loans when the transaction is made. But it has the effect of getting an NPA off the books of the bank or 'cleaning up the balance sheet'. The bank's capital is eroded to the extent of the loss. However, since 100 per cent of the loan has exited the balance sheet, the ratio of regulatory capital to assets — or what is called 'capital adequacy'— improves. The bank now looks more attractive to investors. <br><br>The bad bank proposal is a variant of the fourth option. The idea is to transfer NPAs of banks, perhaps only PSBs, to the bad bank. The bad bank will manage these NPAs in suitable ways — some may be liquidated, others may be restructured, etc. Getting NPAs off the books will help the PSB management focus on new business instead of having to expend their energies on trying to effect recoveries. A bad bank will be better focused on the task of recovery. If it's a private entity, it can also bring in superior expertise. It would appear that the bad bank concept has many things going for it. <br><br>Alas, the devil, as always, is in the detail. First, who will have the majority stake in the bad bank? Will it be the government or private investors? Let us suppose it's the former. Given the size of NPAs at PSBs, the capital required by a bad bank for acquiring NPAs will be substantial. If the government is to be the majority owner, how does it find the required funds? Second, a government-owned bad bank will be subject to the same constraints in managing bad loans as PSBs. Third, managing the sheer size and diversity of bad loans acquired from multiple PSBs will be a tall order. Last, a government entity may not be able to pay specialists what it takes. Whichever way you look at it, a government-owned bad bank appears to be transferring the problem from one part of the government to another. <br><br>Now consider the second possibility, namely, that private investors have a majority stake in the bad bank. These could be long-term investors such as sovereign wealth funds and pension funds. In this case, the price at which PSB loans are sold to the bad bank could become a major issue. If the price is too high, the bad bank will not be <strong>viable</strong>. If it's too low, PSBs will be accused of selling their loans too cheaply to private investors — we will have the makings of an 'NPA scam'. <br><br>There are other issues with transferring NPAs to a bad bank. As former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan pointed out, a big chunk of NPAs at PSBs pertains to projects that are viable. These projects have not gone through to completion for reasons that are mostly extraneous to the project, such as problems in land acquisition or environmental clearance. With restructuring and additional funding, they can be completed and would create significant capacities. Selling these loans to a bad bank, on the other hand, would be a time-consuming process. It would impede fresh flow of funds into these projects. Their debt would rise as the interest piles up. Mr. Rajan had pointed out that bad banks were typically intended for situations where projects were not viable. They were not meant for a situation such as ours where projects are viable. <br><br>The bad bank idea thus <strong>bristles </strong>with problems. So what could be the motivation for floating it? Well, a big motivation would be to dress up the PSBs by getting rid of their bad loans. Then, private capital can be attracted to them, perhaps through the sale of small stakes to strategic investors.

Let us see how the experiment goes.</div></div><div id="Language_Skills" class="question-details-Language-skill"><b>Type:&nbsp;</b> MCQ Single &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Marks:&nbsp;</b>  +1/-0 &nbsp;&nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Topic:&nbsp;</b> Verbal &gt; Reading Comprehension  &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Time Spent:&nbsp;</b><div>0 Mins 0 Secs</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-paper-number">28.&nbsp; </div> <div class="question-paper-question-text">According to the author, what can be a negative side of a government led bad bank?</div></div><div class="question-paper-options"><div class="question-paper-option">A.&nbsp; The government is run by vote bank politics.</div><div class="question-paper-option">B.&nbsp;The government is already saddled with corruption.</div><div class="question-paper-option">C.&nbsp;The government has been ignoring the problem.</div><div class="question-paper-option">D.&nbsp;The government might not be able to pay enough money to the specialists.</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-status-solution">Status : &nbsp;<div class="unanswered-answer">Unanswered</div></div></div><div class="question-paper-text-actual-solution"><b>Answer :  D</b></div><div class="solution"><div data-accordion-component="Accordion" class="accordion"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItem" class="accordion__item"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemHeading" role="heading" class="accordion__heading" aria-level="3"><div id="accordion__heading-27" aria-disabled="false" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accordion__panel-27" role="button" tabindex="0" class="accordion__button" data-accordion-component="AccordionItemButton">View Solution</div></div><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemPanel" class="accordion__panel" role="region" aria-labelledby="accordion__heading-27" id="accordion__panel-27" hidden="">Refer to the seventh paragraph for the answer.</div></div></div></div><div class="bookmark-question"><button class="bookmark-button Button__StyledButton-sc-1o41kgk-0 hHWAHx" spacing="default" type="button"><span style="align-self: center; display: inline-flex; flex-wrap: nowrap; max-width: 100%; position: relative;"><span style="align-items: center; align-self: center; flex: 1 1 auto; margin: 0px 4px; max-width: 100%; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; transition: opacity 0.3s ease 0s; opacity: 1;"><span class="sc-iQKALj jOPeQg"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation"><path d="M12 16.373l3.98 2.193-.76-4.655 3.276-3.347-4.524-.69L12 5.687l-1.972 4.189-4.524.689L8.78 13.91l-.762 4.655L12 16.373zm0 2.283l-3.016 1.662a2 2 0 0 1-2.939-2.075l.599-3.656-2.57-2.624a2 2 0 0 1 1.129-3.377l3.47-.528 1.518-3.224a2 2 0 0 1 3.618 0l1.519 3.224 3.47.528a2 2 0 0 1 1.127 3.377l-2.569 2.624.599 3.656a2 2 0 0 1-2.94 2.075L12 18.656z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></span>Bookmark</span></span></button><button class="bookmark-button Button__StyledButton-sc-1o41kgk-0 hHWAHx" spacing="default" type="button"><span style="align-self: center; display: inline-flex; flex-wrap: nowrap; max-width: 100%; position: relative;"><span style="align-items: center; align-self: center; flex: 1 1 auto; margin: 0px 4px; max-width: 100%; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; transition: opacity 0.3s ease 0s; opacity: 1;"><span class="sc-iQKALj jOPeQg"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation"><path d="M6 12.235v6.446c0 .537.45.977 1 .977s1-.44 1-.977v-5.778c1.17-.341 2.389-.045 3.768.29.982.238 2.036.495 3.13.495a5.73 5.73 0 0 0 2.547-.567 1 1 0 0 0 .563-.9V5.466a.998.998 0 0 0-1.437-.9c-1.345.654-2.731.317-4.331-.071-1.729-.42-3.687-.895-5.678.072A1 1 0 0 0 6 5.466v6.769zm3.111-1.48c1.094 0 2.148.256 3.129.495 1.381.335 2.6.63 3.768.289V6.836c-1.488.27-2.93-.08-4.24-.398-1.379-.335-2.598-.632-3.768-.29v4.704a6.195 6.195 0 0 1 1.111-.097z" fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></span> Share question feedback</span></span></button></div><hr></div><div class="question-div-paper"><div class="passage-details"><div class="passage-header"><b> Passage :</b></div><div class="passage-header">Read the following passage to answer the questions based on it. Some words/phrases are given in bold to help you locate them while answering some of the questions. <br><br>Indian banks' pile of bad loans is a huge drag on the economy. It's a drain on banks' profits. Because profits are eroded, public sector banks (PSBs), where the bulk of the bad loans reside, cannot raise enough capital to fund credit growth. Lack of credit growth, in turn, comes in the way of the economy's return to an 8 per cent growth trajectory. Clearly, the bad loan problem requires effective resolution. <br><br>A proposal floated a few years ago is doing the rounds again, namely, the creation of a 'bad bank' that would house the bad loans in the PSB system. The proposal has its merits. However, making a success of it in the Indian context poses significant challenges. Before we examine the proposal, it's best to have an idea of how banks deal with bad loans. Once an asset is recognised as a non-performing asset (NPA), banks must decide what to do with it. They have several options. One, they can try to seize the assets pledged by the borrower and sell these. This typically involves large losses on loans as the assets have to be sold at steep discounts to their book value. <br><br>Two, under the RBI's Strategic Debt Restructuring (SDR) scheme, they can convert their loans into equity, acquire a majority stake in the firm, dislodge the promoters or management and bring in new promoters and management. While this happens in advanced economies all the time, the SDR scheme has not taken off in India. Indian banks do not have experience in running businesses till such time as new promoters are found. Nor do they have experience in locating promoters and management who can take over the stressed assets. <br><br>Three, banks can restructure the loans so that borrowers are able to service them. This involves stretching out the period of payment, or <strong>waiving </strong>a portion of the loans, or reducing the interest rate on loans, or some combination of these. In any restructuring, banks <strong>incur </strong>losses on the loans they have made. At PSBs, managers are open to the charge that they have favoured borrowers in a restructuring scheme and can invite action from the investigative agencies. In today's environment, this has resulted in virtual paralysis at PSBs. <br><br>A fourth option for banks is to sell the NPA at a discount to an Asset Restructuring Company. This again involves a significant loss on loans when the transaction is made. But it has the effect of getting an NPA off the books of the bank or 'cleaning up the balance sheet'. The bank's capital is eroded to the extent of the loss. However, since 100 per cent of the loan has exited the balance sheet, the ratio of regulatory capital to assets — or what is called 'capital adequacy'— improves. The bank now looks more attractive to investors. <br><br>The bad bank proposal is a variant of the fourth option. The idea is to transfer NPAs of banks, perhaps only PSBs, to the bad bank. The bad bank will manage these NPAs in suitable ways — some may be liquidated, others may be restructured, etc. Getting NPAs off the books will help the PSB management focus on new business instead of having to expend their energies on trying to effect recoveries. A bad bank will be better focused on the task of recovery. If it's a private entity, it can also bring in superior expertise. It would appear that the bad bank concept has many things going for it. <br><br>Alas, the devil, as always, is in the detail. First, who will have the majority stake in the bad bank? Will it be the government or private investors? Let us suppose it's the former. Given the size of NPAs at PSBs, the capital required by a bad bank for acquiring NPAs will be substantial. If the government is to be the majority owner, how does it find the required funds? Second, a government-owned bad bank will be subject to the same constraints in managing bad loans as PSBs. Third, managing the sheer size and diversity of bad loans acquired from multiple PSBs will be a tall order. Last, a government entity may not be able to pay specialists what it takes. Whichever way you look at it, a government-owned bad bank appears to be transferring the problem from one part of the government to another. <br><br>Now consider the second possibility, namely, that private investors have a majority stake in the bad bank. These could be long-term investors such as sovereign wealth funds and pension funds. In this case, the price at which PSB loans are sold to the bad bank could become a major issue. If the price is too high, the bad bank will not be <strong>viable</strong>. If it's too low, PSBs will be accused of selling their loans too cheaply to private investors — we will have the makings of an 'NPA scam'. <br><br>There are other issues with transferring NPAs to a bad bank. As former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan pointed out, a big chunk of NPAs at PSBs pertains to projects that are viable. These projects have not gone through to completion for reasons that are mostly extraneous to the project, such as problems in land acquisition or environmental clearance. With restructuring and additional funding, they can be completed and would create significant capacities. Selling these loans to a bad bank, on the other hand, would be a time-consuming process. It would impede fresh flow of funds into these projects. Their debt would rise as the interest piles up. Mr. Rajan had pointed out that bad banks were typically intended for situations where projects were not viable. They were not meant for a situation such as ours where projects are viable. <br><br>The bad bank idea thus <strong>bristles </strong>with problems. So what could be the motivation for floating it? Well, a big motivation would be to dress up the PSBs by getting rid of their bad loans. Then, private capital can be attracted to them, perhaps through the sale of small stakes to strategic investors. PSBs would also be able to access the equity markets for funds and would not be as dependent on the government for capital. Today's weaker PSBs can be <strong>merged </strong>with the stronger ones. <br><br>Is there a way in which the positives can be realised without creating a bad bank that itself requires too much capital and is too big to manage? One answer may be to set up a bad bank to deal with NPAs at some of the weaker PSBs, instead of one that picks up NPAs from all PSBs. It would prove less controversial if the government had a majority stake in it. Let us see how the experiment goes.</div></div><div id="Language_Skills" class="question-details-Language-skill"><b>Type:&nbsp;</b> MCQ Single &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Marks:&nbsp;</b>  +1/-0 &nbsp;&nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Topic:&nbsp;</b> Verbal &gt; Reading Comprehension  &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Time Spent:&nbsp;</b><div>0 Mins 0 Secs</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-paper-number">29.&nbsp; </div> <div class="question-paper-question-text">According to the former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan, what is the disadvantage of transferring an NPA at a public sector bank to a bad bank?</div></div><div class="question-paper-options"><div class="question-paper-option">A.&nbsp;<p>It would impede fresh flow of funds into the projects of an NPA.&nbsp;</p>
