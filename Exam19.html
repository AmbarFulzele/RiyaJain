The questions are to be answered on the basis of what is stated or implied in the passage. Kindly note that more than one of the choices may conceivably answer some of the questions. However, you are to choose the most appropriate answer, that is, the response that most accurately and completely answers the question.<br><br>Controlling the Internet censorship plays a role in everything that is portrayed on the Internet. However, due to its size and rapid growth, it has become almost impossible to control the Internet. In 1989, the World Wide Web was developed. This new technology enabled Internet users to exchange information on a global scale. With no restrictions on what information could be shared, the Internet has become home to an assortment of web sites consisting of topics that are shunned from the mainstream media. For example, literature that was banned from high schools and colleges for content that contained sexually explicit, anti-religious or immoral material has been made available through websites, such as “Banned Books On-Line”. Over the last couple of decades, governments have struggled to regulate the content of the Internet. For example, in 1996 the Congress of the United States passed the “Communications Decency Act”, which made it a crime to transmit indecent material over the Internet. Materials such as child-pornography were deemed offensive and thus distributors must be prosecuted. <br><br>To help catch Internet content violators, organizations such as the “Internet Police” were created. The “Internet Police”, help to regulate the Internet by reporting illegal websites, pressuring governments to apply relevant legislation, blocking illegal material and reporting attempts by people to access child pornography. Many Internet users, industry experts and civil liberties groups were against the Communications Decency Act. Websites such as “The Electronic Frontier Foundation”, were created to uphold the rights to free digital expression against political and legal threats. Anti-censorship followers feel that the government's actions are infringing on their freedom of speech. When taken to the Supreme Court in 1997, the court was forced to abolish the Act because it was unconstitutional. Internet censorship can sometimes vary depending on the country. For example, in communist countries such as China, western ideologies conveyed on the Internet are seen as harmful to the solidarity of the Chinese government. As such, all emails leaving and entering the country are screened and edited by government officials. But, sometimes messages are even deleted if they are seen as being harmful to national interests. Recently, the Chinese government tried to develop its own “China World Web” in order to censor any unwanted western messages. <br><br>The Internet is more like the everyday world, with all of its promises and problems, than a reflection of academia or an island village. While it's become a tremendous tool for commerce and information, it has also become a home to thieves, terrorists and vandals. The Internet conceals malicious users. The remote nature of the Internet also creates a false sense of security. Many users log on in blissful ignorance, believing they're okay because they can't see or feel any threats. Even after learning that their workstations or websites have been broken into multiple times, many fail to understand the threats lurking on the other end of the wire. Systems are routinely attacked by multiple vectors, worms carried in by e-mails, bandwidth consumed by floods of bogus traffic, and workstation CPUs hijacked through some unpatched vulnerability.</div></div><div id="Language_Skills" class="question-details-Language-skill"><b>Type:&nbsp;</b> MCQ Single &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Marks:&nbsp;</b>  +3/-0 &nbsp;&nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Topic:&nbsp;</b> Verbal &gt; Reading Comprehension  &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Time Spent:&nbsp;</b><div>1 Mins 59 Secs</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-paper-number">1.&nbsp; </div> <div class="question-paper-question-text">According to the passage, which of the following is not included in the positive evaluations made by the author about the Internet?</div></div><div class="question-paper-options"><div class="question-paper-option">A.&nbsp;Internet enables us to exchange information on a global scale.</div><div class="question-paper-option">B.&nbsp;Internet has given a huge boost to commerce.</div><div class="question-paper-option">C.&nbsp; Internet provides space to a number of web sites.</div><div class="question-paper-option">D.&nbsp; Internet is available round-the-clock.</div><div class="question-paper-option">E.&nbsp;The 'China World Web' has been formed by the Chinese government.</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-status-solution">Status : &nbsp;<div class="unanswered-answer">Unanswered</div></div></div><div class="question-paper-text-actual-solution"><b>Answer :  D</b></div><div class="solution"><div data-accordion-component="Accordion" class="accordion"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItem" class="accordion__item"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemHeading" role="heading" class="accordion__heading" aria-level="3"><div id="accordion__heading-0" aria-disabled="false" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accordion__panel-0" role="button" tabindex="0" class="accordion__button" data-accordion-component="AccordionItemButton"></div></div><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemPanel" class="accordion__panel" role="region" aria-labelledby="accordion__heading-0" id="accordion__panel-0" ><p>Options (1) and (3) are mentioned in the first paragraph while option (2) is mentioned in the third paragraph.

With no restrictions on what information could be shared, the Internet has become home to an assortment of web sites consisting of topics that are shunned from the mainstream media. For example, literature that was banned from high schools and colleges for content that contained sexually explicit, anti-religious or immoral material has been made available through websites, such as “Banned Books On-Line”. Over the last couple of decades, governments have struggled to regulate the content of the Internet. For example, in 1996 the Congress of the United States passed the “Communications Decency Act”, which made it a crime to transmit indecent material over the Internet. Materials such as child-pornography were deemed offensive and thus distributors must be prosecuted. <br><br>To help catch Internet content violators, organizations such as the “Internet Police” were created. The “Internet Police”, help to regulate the Internet by reporting illegal websites, pressuring governments to apply relevant legislation, blocking illegal material and reporting attempts by people to access child pornography. Many Internet users, industry experts and civil liberties groups were against the Communications Decency Act. Websites such as “The Electronic Frontier Foundation”, were created to uphold the rights to free digital expression against political and legal threats. Anti-censorship followers feel that the government's actions are infringing on their freedom of speech. When taken to the Supreme Court in 1997, the court was forced to abolish the Act because it was unconstitutional. Internet censorship can sometimes vary depending on the country. For example, in communist countries such as China, western ideologies conveyed on the Internet are seen as harmful to the solidarity of the Chinese government. As such, all emails leaving and entering the country are screened and edited by government officials. But, sometimes messages are even deleted if they are seen as being harmful to national interests. Recently, the Chinese government tried to develop its own “China World Web” in order to censor any unwanted western messages. <br><br>The Internet is more like the everyday world, with all of its promises and problems, than a reflection of academia or an island village. While it's become a tremendous tool for commerce and information, it has also become a home to thieves, terrorists and vandals. The Internet conceals malicious users. The remote nature of the Internet also creates a false sense of security. Many users log on in blissful ignorance, believing they're okay because they can't see or feel any threats. Even after learning that their workstations or websites have been broken into multiple times, many fail to understand the threats lurking on the other end of the wire. Systems are routinely attacked by multiple vectors, worms carried in by e-mails, bandwidth consumed by floods of bogus traffic, and workstation CPUs hijacked through some unpatched vulnerability.</div></div><div id="Language_Skills" class="question-details-Language-skill"><b>Type:&nbsp;</b> MCQ Single &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Marks:&nbsp;</b>  +3/-0 &nbsp;&nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Topic:&nbsp;</b> Verbal &gt; Reading Comprehension  &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Time Spent:&nbsp;</b><div>0 Mins 0 Secs</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-paper-number">4.&nbsp; </div> <div class="question-paper-question-text">According to the passage, which of the following is a disadvantage faced by an Internet user?</div></div><div class="question-paper-options"><div class="question-paper-option">A.&nbsp;The sense of comfort established by the internet prevents the user from identifying the dangers that are lurking around him.</div><div class="question-paper-option">B.&nbsp;The amount of information available can easily confuse the user and lead to information overload.</div><div class="question-paper-option">C.&nbsp;All the sources of information available on the internet are not reliable and user-friendly.</div><div class="question-paper-option">D.&nbsp;The Internet provides a sense of security to the user which encourages misconduct and promotes blissful ignorance.</div><div class="question-paper-option">E.&nbsp;<p>None of these</p>

<br>
Once a rich merchant presented a beautiful cat to the Emperor of China. Eventually, the emperor became fond of the animal and took it with him wherever he went. Everywhere, people kept asking the emperor, what was the cat named and everyone was surprised, when told that it had no name. As time progressed, the emperor realised that the cat should have a name. Thus he decided to find a suitable name for his pet. He called his ministers, the seven wisest men in his empire and commanded them to find a suitable name within seven days. The ministers were warned that if they did not succeed in finding a name by the end of seven days, they would be punished. Also, the minister whose suggestion would be accepted would received hundred gold pieces.<br>
<br>
The ministers did a lot of research on names that would suit the emperor's favourite pet. At the of this period, they was summoned to the place again, and asked for their suggestions. The youngest of the group thought he had found the perfect name. “TIGER!" he announced proudly, “your majesty, as we all know tigers are powerful animal, it will be the best name for your pet cat." “Good name", said the emperor, after a moment's reflection. “The tiger is not only a noble and powerful beast but it is also known as the cat's cousin," added the emperor.<br>
<br>
“Noble, perhaps", said the second minister, “but it is not as powerful as the dragon. Can a tiger soar into the sky? No but a dragon can! I think DRAGON would be a more suitable name for the cat." As the emperor was contemplating the name DRAGON,the third minister said, “Clouds can go higher than dragons. A cloud is more powerful than a dragon. “let's call it CLOUD". “Let's not be hasty", advised the fourth wise man “Cloud may fly high but they are ushed around by winds. Winds are more powerful than clouds. WIND would be the most appropriate name for a great emperor's pet." The emperor was still not satisfied with the suggestions. “WIND?" said the emperor doubtfully. “Isn't there anything better?" The fifth wise man took this opportunity to give his suggestion. “BRICK WALL!" The king exclaimed. “Why should I name my cat BRICK WALL?" “Well BRICK WALL, is not a bad name. But isn't it a bit long?" The fifth minister replied, “A brick wall can stop the winds". “I have a shorter name," said the sixth minister, “RAT". Everyone started laughing at his suggestion. “So you suggest that I must call my cat RAT?" The sixth minister replied, “Yes, Your Majesty, RAT! A rat can eat through a brick wall, which makes it more powerful than the wall, more powerful than the wind, more powerful than all the suggestions given to you." “I get your point," interrupted the emperor, “but can you call a cat, RAT?"<br>
<br>
“Indeed you can't!" piped up the seventh wise man who was the eldest among all seven. “A cat is a cat. How can one call cat RAT? Also if a rat is more powerful than the other the cat is even more so because it is mightier than the rat." The emperor was impressed with the seventh minister's suggestion and decided to accept it. So the royal pet remained namless in a way because from then on it was simply called CAT. But the minister who suggested this name was rewarded as promised.</p>

A cloud is more powerful than a dragon. “let's call it CLOUD". “Let's not be hasty", advised the fourth wise man “Cloud may fly high but they are ushed around by winds. Winds are more powerful than clouds. WIND would be the most appropriate name for a great emperor's pet." The emperor was still not satisfied with the suggestions. “WIND?" said the emperor doubtfully. “Isn't there anything better?" The fifth wise man took this opportunity to give his suggestion. “BRICK WALL!" The king exclaimed. “Why should I name my cat BRICK WALL?" “Well BRICK WALL, is not a bad name. But isn't it a bit long?" The fifth minister replied, “A brick wall can stop the winds". “I have a shorter name," said the sixth minister, “RAT". Everyone started laughing at his suggestion. “So you suggest that I must call my cat RAT?" The sixth minister replied, “Yes, Your Majesty, RAT! A rat can eat through a brick wall, which makes it more powerful than the wall, more powerful than the wind, more powerful than all the suggestions given to you." “I get your point," interrupted the emperor, “but can you call a cat, RAT?"<br>
<br>
“Indeed you can't!" piped up the seventh wise man who was the eldest among all seven. “A cat is a cat. How can one call cat RAT? Also if a rat is more powerful than the other the cat is even more so because it is mightier than the rat." The emperor was impressed with the seventh minister's suggestion and decided to accept it. So the royal pet remained namless in a way because from then on it was simply called CAT. But the minister who suggested this name was rewarded as promised.</p>

<br>
Once a rich merchant presented a beautiful cat to the Emperor of China. Eventually, the emperor became fond of the animal and took it with him wherever he went. Everywhere, people kept asking the emperor, what was the cat named and everyone was surprised, when told that it had no name. As time progressed, the emperor realised that the cat should have a name. Thus he decided to find a suitable name for his pet. He called his ministers, the seven wisest men in his empire and commanded them to find a suitable name within seven days. The ministers were warned that if they did not succeed in finding a name by the end of seven days, they would be punished. Also, the minister whose suggestion would be accepted would received hundred gold pieces.<br>
<br>
The ministers did a lot of research on names that would suit the emperor's favourite pet. At the of this period, they was summoned to the place again, and asked for their suggestions. The youngest of the group thought he had found the perfect name. “TIGER!" he announced proudly, “your majesty, as we all know tigers are powerful animal, it will be the best name for your pet cat." “Good name", said the emperor, after a moment's reflection. “The tiger is not only a noble and powerful beast but it is also known as the cat's cousin," added the emperor.<br>
<br>
“Noble, perhaps", said the second minister, “but it is not as powerful as the dragon. Can a tiger soar into the sky? No but a dragon can! I think DRAGON would be a more suitable name for the cat." As the emperor was contemplating the name DRAGON,the third minister said, “Clouds can go higher than dragons. A cloud is more powerful than a dragon. “let's call it CLOUD". “Let's not be hasty", advised the fourth wise man “Cloud may fly high but they are ushed around by winds. Winds are more powerful than clouds. WIND would be the most appropriate name for a great emperor's pet." The emperor was still not satisfied with the suggestions. “WIND?" said the emperor doubtfully. “Isn't there anything better?"

Elderly people with few worries and little stress are probably better protected against the progress of Alzheimer's disease than their peers who are under psychological pressure. Stress can promote the kind of brain degeneration that leads to symptoms of dementia, according to Argentine researchers attending a recent congress of the European Neurological Society in Prague.<br>
The researchers said this was a good reason to pay greater heed to psychological health among the elderly. Alzheimer's is said to be the most common form of dementia in the world, with the risk factors found to be age, high blood pressure, diabetes, and physical and mental idleness.</p>
