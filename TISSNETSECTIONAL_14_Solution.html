Choose the best answer to each question.<br><br>In the dojo of the origami purist, there are only two rules: The folder may use just one sheet of square paper, and the paper cannot be cut or torn in any way. Following these rules to make a figure like a peace crane, with four basic features—a head, a tail, and two wings—is relatively easy, and origamists traditionally proceeded by trial and error, unfolding and refolding a piece of paper until it started to resemble, say, a swan. For hundreds of years, origami's most complex patterns topped out at 20 steps.<br><br>These days patterns requiring more than 100 steps are common. Some of that competitive acceleration is due to Lang, who transformed the art by writing a computer program that can generate the blueprint for ultracomplex origami sculptures. Even with digital assistance, figuring out the sequence of folds that will create a beetle and all its ornaments is a mathematical problem of staggering complexity. Still, the reigning champion of intricate origami is a 23-year-old Japanese savant named Satoshi Kamiya. Unaided by software, he recently produced what is considered the pinnacle of the field, an eight-inch-tall Eastern dragon with eyes, teeth, a curly tongue, sinuous whiskers, a barbed tail, and a thousand overlapping scales. The folding alone took 40 hours, spread out over several months.<br><br>“It's like an extreme sport,” says Tom Hull, a mathematician at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, and longtime origami enthusiast. The escalation in difficulty has grown so severe that Origami USA has been forced to add a new difficulty rating to the four (simple, low intermediate, high intermediate, and complex) it has traditionally used. “People showing up to the complex sessions were getting blown to smithereens,” Hull explains. “So now there's a new category: supercomplex.”<br><br>At its core, origami consists of just two folds, mountain and valley. A mountain fold is what you get if you crease a piece of paper so that it stands up like a pup tent. A valley fold is the same thing turned upside down. Valley folding each corner of a square so that they meet in the center creates something that looks a bit like a cheese blintz and is therefore known as a blintz fold. Beyond these two basic folds, the grammar of origami proliferates rapidly. It's possible to blintz a petal fold, or double blintz it. Likewise, combining a series of squash and petal folds yields a frog base—one of the four traditional bases (called kite, fish, bird, and frog) from which many traditional origami animals are fashioned.<br><br>“All the parts of a base are linked together and can't be altered without affecting the rest of the paper, so that's the part you have to calculate just right,” Lang says. A base with four flaps is relatively easy to make. Each flap is formed from one of the corners of the square. Making a base with 17 flaps of the right size and in the right places—what you'd need to create Lang's flying rhinoceros beetle—is exponentially more difficult. “Figuring out how to make good legs was all people did for years,” Tom Hull says. “Doing a sixlegged beetle was a big, big deal.”<br><br>Lang resisted the challenge for a while. He spent most of the past two decades working as a laser physicist—first at Caltech, then later for private firms in Silicon Valley—and devoted his off-hours to origami. By 2002, his interest in origami won out. He quit his job and began folding paper for a living. Since then, he has created everything from a ruby-throated hummingbird to a full-scale human (commissioned for a German trade show). The jobs are sometimes banal—there's a lot of demand for cardboard fast-food containers that change shape—but every now and then Lang gets tapped for a more challenging project. He has been asked to simulate the folds of a car's air bag when packed into a steering column and to design a telescope lens that could be, shot into space, packed into a nine-foot cylinder and then unfurled to the size of a football field. He also recently consulted on the development of an origami-inspired medical implant, which he can't talk about other than to say that it was “big, permanent, and what keeps the person alive.” Origami also turns out to be useful for biological problems, such as determining how proteins fold in the body.be, shot into space, packed into a nine-foot cylinder and then unfurled to the size of a football field. He also recently consulted on the development of an origami-inspired medical implant, which he can't talk about other than to say that it was “big, permanent, and what keeps the person alive.” Origami also turns out to be useful for biological problems, such as determining how proteins fold in the body. <br><br>Over the past 15 years, Lang has been perfecting a program he wrote called TreeMaker, which can render a stick-figure sketch into a crease pattern—the web of lines that would be left if a finished piece of origami were unfolded and then smoothed. The software converts the sketch into a set of equations that calculate how the appendages of a complex animal form, like a deer, should be distributed on the paper in a way that ensures they will neatly emerge during folding without leaving excess paper or creating areas so wadded up that they can't be folded.<br><br>Calculating this, as mathematicians like to say when facing a daunting challenge, is not trivial. Fold a square piece of paper diagonally, then fold it in half, and the result will be a small isosceles triangle. Switch the order of those folds—in half first, then diagonally—and you end up with a squashed pentagon. The more folds a pattern has, the harder the problem of finding a folding sequence becomes. For one of his TreeMaker-guided designs—a life-size, anatomically correct Maine lobster—Lang was able to generate the crease pattern on the computer in just a few hours. Figuring out how to fold the 120-step pattern on a sheet of paper about 20 inches square took him almost two years.<br><br>“The mind-set to do advanced design is fragile,” Lang says soberly. “You have to hold all these complex surfaces in your mind and figure out how they interact. If you're pushing the edge of the envelope on something like this, you need total concentration. Sometimes you'll have 5, 10, 20 creases, and you have to make them all happen at once. You need to develop an intuition about it.”<br><br>To perfect their folding technique, Lang notes, rookies must also attend to details like not creasing folds too sharply. “Do that and your piece will end up looking tatty. Plus, if there's a point where a lot of those creases come together, the paper can burst. It just puts too much strain on the fibers."</div></div><div id="Language_Skills" class="question-details-Language-skill"><b>Type:&nbsp;</b> MCQ Single &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Marks:&nbsp;</b>  +1/-0 &nbsp;&nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Topic:&nbsp;</b> Verbal &gt; Reading Comprehension  &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Time Spent:&nbsp;</b><div>0 Mins 0 Secs</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-paper-number">10.&nbsp; </div> <div class="question-paper-question-text">Which of the following is NOT a point made by the author while discussing the rules of the origami purist?</div></div><div class="question-paper-options"><div class="question-paper-option">A.&nbsp;Just one sheet of hand – made paper may be used.</div><div class="question-paper-option">B.&nbsp; The paper cannot be cut in any way.</div><div class="question-paper-option">C.&nbsp;The piece cannot be ripped.</div><div class="question-paper-option">D.&nbsp;The folder may use only one sheet of square paper.</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-status-solution">Status : &nbsp;<div class="unanswered-answer">Unanswered</div></div></div><div class="question-paper-text-actual-solution"><b>Answer :  A</b></div><div class="solution"><div data-accordion-component="Accordion" class="accordion"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItem" class="accordion__item"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemHeading" role="heading" class="accordion__heading" aria-level="3"><div id="accordion__heading-9" aria-disabled="false" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accordion__panel-9" role="button" tabindex="0" class="accordion__button" data-accordion-component="AccordionItemButton"></div></div><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemPanel" class="accordion__panel" role="region" aria-labelledby="accordion__heading-9" id="accordion__panel-9" >The passage does not state the type or quality of paper to be used for origami.</div></div></div></div><div class="bookmark-question"><button class="bookmark-button Button__StyledButton-sc-1o41kgk-0 hHWAHx" spacing="default" type="button"><span style="align-self: center; display: inline-flex; flex-wrap: nowrap; max-width: 100%; position: relative;"><span style="align-items: center; align-self: center; flex: 1 1 auto; margin: 0px 4px; max-width: 100%; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; transition: opacity 0.3s ease 0s; opacity: 1;"><span class="sc-iQKALj jOPeQg"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation"><path d="M12 16.373l3.98 2.193-.76-4.655 3.276-3.347-4.524-.69L12 5.687l-1.972 4.189-4.524.689L8.78 13.91l-.762 4.655L12 16.373zm0 2.283l-3.016 1.662a2 2 0 0 1-2.939-2.075l.599-3.656-2.57-2.624a2 2 0 0 1 1.129-3.377l3.47-.528 1.518-3.224a2 2 0 0 1 3.618 0l1.519 3.224 3.47.528a2 2 0 0 1 1.127 3.377l-2.569 2.624.599 3.656a2 2 0 0 1-2.94 2.075L12 18.656z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></span>Bookmark</span></span></button><button class="bookmark-button Button__StyledButton-sc-1o41kgk-0 hHWAHx" spacing="default" type="button"><span style="align-self: center; display: inline-flex; flex-wrap: nowrap; max-width: 100%; position: relative;"><span style="align-items: center; align-self: center; flex: 1 1 auto; margin: 0px 4px; max-width: 100%; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; transition: opacity 0.3s ease 0s; opacity: 1;"><span class="sc-iQKALj jOPeQg"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation"><path d="M6 12.235v6.446c0 .537.45.977 1 .977s1-.44 1-.977v-5.778c1.17-.341 2.389-.045 3.768.29.982.238 2.036.495 3.13.495a5.73 5.73 0 0 0 2.547-.567 1 1 0 0 0 .563-.9V5.466a.998.998 0 0 0-1.437-.9c-1.345.654-2.731.317-4.331-.071-1.729-.42-3.687-.895-5.678.072A1 1 0 0 0 6 5.466v6.769zm3.111-1.48c1.094 0 2.148.256 3.129.495 1.381.335 2.6.63 3.768.289V6.836c-1.488.27-2.93-.08-4.24-.398-1.379-.335-2.598-.632-3.768-.29v4.704a6.195 6.195 0 0 1 1.111-.097z" fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></span> Share question feedback</span></span></button></div><hr></div><div class="question-div-paper"><div class="passage-details"><div class="passage-header"><b> Passage :</b></div><div class="passage-header">The passage given below is followed by a set of questions.

Choose the best answer to each question.<br><br>In the dojo of the origami purist, there are only two rules: The folder may use just one sheet of square paper, and the paper cannot be cut or torn in any way. Following these rules to make a figure like a peace crane, with four basic features—a head, a tail, and two wings—is relatively easy, and origamists traditionally proceeded by trial and error, unfolding and refolding a piece of paper until it started to resemble, say, a swan. For hundreds of years, origami's most complex patterns topped out at 20 steps.<br><br>These days patterns requiring more than 100 steps are common. Some of that competitive acceleration is due to Lang, who transformed the art by writing a computer program that can generate the blueprint for ultracomplex origami sculptures. Even with digital assistance, figuring out the sequence of folds that will create a beetle and all its ornaments is a mathematical problem of staggering complexity. Still, the reigning champion of intricate origami is a 23-year-old Japanese savant named Satoshi Kamiya. Unaided by software, he recently produced what is considered the pinnacle of the field, an eight-inch-tall Eastern dragon with eyes, teeth, a curly tongue, sinuous whiskers, a barbed tail, and a thousand overlapping scales. The folding alone took 40 hours, spread out over several months.<br><br>“It's like an extreme sport,” says Tom Hull, a mathematician at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, and longtime origami enthusiast. The escalation in difficulty has grown so severe that Origami USA has been forced to add a new difficulty rating to the four (simple, low intermediate, high intermediate, and complex) it has traditionally used. “People showing up to the complex sessions were getting blown to smithereens,” Hull explains. “So now there's a new category: supercomplex.”<br><br>At its core, origami consists of just two folds, mountain and valley. A mountain fold is what you get if you crease a piece of paper so that it stands up like a pup tent. A valley fold is the same thing turned upside down. Valley folding each corner of a square so that they meet in the center creates something that looks a bit like a cheese blintz and is therefore known as a blintz fold. Beyond these two basic folds, the grammar of origami proliferates rapidly. It's possible to blintz a petal fold, or double blintz it. Likewise, combining a series of squash and petal folds yields a frog base—one of the four traditional bases (called kite, fish, bird, and frog) from which many traditional origami animals are fashioned.<br><br>“All the parts of a base are linked together and can't be altered without affecting the rest of the paper, so that's the part you have to calculate just right,” Lang says. A base with four flaps is relatively easy to make. Each flap is formed from one of the corners of the square. Making a base with 17 flaps of the right size and in the right places—what you'd need to create Lang's flying rhinoceros beetle—is exponentially more difficult. “Figuring out how to make good legs was all people did for years,” Tom Hull says. “Doing a sixlegged beetle was a big, big deal.”<br><br>Lang resisted the challenge for a while. He spent most of the past two decades working as a laser physicist—first at Caltech, then later for private firms in Silicon Valley—and devoted his off-hours to origami. By 2002, his interest in origami won out. He quit his job and began folding paper for a living. Since then, he has created everything from a ruby-throated hummingbird to a full-scale human (commissioned for a German trade show). The jobs are sometimes banal—there's a lot of demand for cardboard fast-food containers that change shape—but every now and then Lang gets tapped for a more challenging project. He has been asked to simulate the folds of a car's air bag when packed into a steering column and to design a telescope lens that could be, shot into space, packed into a nine-foot cylinder and then unfurled to the size of a football field. He also recently consulted on the development of an origami-inspired medical implant, which he can't talk about other than to say that it was “big, permanent, and what keeps the person alive.” Origami also turns out to be useful for biological problems, such as determining how proteins fold in the body.be, shot into space, packed into a nine-foot cylinder and then unfurled to the size of a football field. He also recently consulted on the development of an origami-inspired medical implant, which he can't talk about other than to say that it was “big, permanent, and what keeps the person alive.” Origami also turns out to be useful for biological problems, such as determining how proteins fold in the body. <br><br>Over the past 15 years, Lang has been perfecting a program he wrote called TreeMaker, which can render a stick-figure sketch into a crease pattern—the web of lines that would be left if a finished piece of origami were unfolded and then smoothed. The software converts the sketch into a set of equations that calculate how the appendages of a complex animal form, like a deer, should be distributed on the paper in a way that ensures they will neatly emerge during folding without leaving excess paper or creating areas so wadded up that they can't be folded.<br><br>Calculating this, as mathematicians like to say when facing a daunting challenge, is not trivial. Fold a square piece of paper diagonally, then fold it in half, and the result will be a small isosceles triangle. Switch the order of those folds—in half first, then diagonally—and you end up with a squashed pentagon. The more folds a pattern has, the harder the problem of finding a folding sequence becomes. For one of his TreeMaker-guided designs—a life-size, anatomically correct Maine lobster—Lang was able to generate the crease pattern on the computer in just a few hours. Figuring out how to fold the 120-step pattern on a sheet of paper about 20 inches square took him almost two years.<br><br>“The mind-set to do advanced design is fragile,” Lang says soberly. “You have to hold all these complex surfaces in your mind and figure out how they interact. If you're pushing the edge of the envelope on something like this, you need total concentration. Sometimes you'll have 5, 10, 20 creases, and you have to make them all happen at once. You need to develop an intuition about it.”<br><br>To perfect their folding technique, Lang notes, rookies must also attend to details like not creasing folds too sharply. “Do that and your piece will end up looking tatty. Plus, if there's a point where a lot of those creases come together, the paper can burst. It just puts too much strain on the fibers."</div></div><div id="Language_Skills" class="question-details-Language-skill"><b>Type:&nbsp;</b> MCQ Single &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Marks:&nbsp;</b>  +1/-0 &nbsp;&nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Topic:&nbsp;</b> Verbal &gt; Reading Comprehension  &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Time Spent:&nbsp;</b><div>0 Mins 0 Secs</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-paper-number">12.&nbsp; </div> <div class="question-paper-question-text">Which of the following is NOT true of the new patterns?</div></div><div class="question-paper-options"><div class="question-paper-option">A.&nbsp; The patterns require more than 100 steps.</div><div class="question-paper-option">B.&nbsp; A computer can generate complex sculptures.</div><div class="question-paper-option">C.&nbsp; The most complex ones top 20 steps.</div><div class="question-paper-option">D.&nbsp; The patterns have the complexity of mathematical problems.</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-status-solution">Status : &nbsp;<div class="unanswered-answer">Unanswered</div></div></div><div class="question-paper-text-actual-solution"><b>Answer :  C</b></div><div class="solution"><div data-accordion-component="Accordion" class="accordion"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItem" class="accordion__item"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemHeading" role="heading" class="accordion__heading" aria-level="3"><div id="accordion__heading-11" aria-disabled="false" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accordion__panel-11" role="button" tabindex="0" class="accordion__button" data-accordion-component="AccordionItemButton"></div></div><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemPanel" class="accordion__panel" role="region" aria-labelledby="accordion__heading-11" id="accordion__panel-11" >All except option (3) are true of the new patterns.

Choose the best answer to each question.<br><br>In the dojo of the origami purist, there are only two rules: The folder may use just one sheet of square paper, and the paper cannot be cut or torn in any way. Following these rules to make a figure like a peace crane, with four basic features—a head, a tail, and two wings—is relatively easy, and origamists traditionally proceeded by trial and error, unfolding and refolding a piece of paper until it started to resemble, say, a swan. For hundreds of years, origami's most complex patterns topped out at 20 steps.<br><br>These days patterns requiring more than 100 steps are common. Some of that competitive acceleration is due to Lang, who transformed the art by writing a computer program that can generate the blueprint for ultracomplex origami sculptures. Even with digital assistance, figuring out the sequence of folds that will create a beetle and all its ornaments is a mathematical problem of staggering complexity. Still, the reigning champion of intricate origami is a 23-year-old Japanese savant named Satoshi Kamiya. Unaided by software, he recently produced what is considered the pinnacle of the field, an eight-inch-tall Eastern dragon with eyes, teeth, a curly tongue, sinuous whiskers, a barbed tail, and a thousand overlapping scales. The folding alone took 40 hours, spread out over several months.<br><br>“It's like an extreme sport,” says Tom Hull, a mathematician at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, and longtime origami enthusiast. The escalation in difficulty has grown so severe that Origami USA has been forced to add a new difficulty rating to the four (simple, low intermediate, high intermediate, and complex) it has traditionally used. “People showing up to the complex sessions were getting blown to smithereens,” Hull explains. “So now there's a new category: supercomplex.”<br><br>At its core, origami consists of just two folds, mountain and valley. A mountain fold is what you get if you crease a piece of paper so that it stands up like a pup tent. A valley fold is the same thing turned upside down. Valley folding each corner of a square so that they meet in the center creates something that looks a bit like a cheese blintz and is therefore known as a blintz fold. Beyond these two basic folds, the grammar of origami proliferates rapidly. It's possible to blintz a petal fold, or double blintz it. Likewise, combining a series of squash and petal folds yields a frog base—one of the four traditional bases (called kite, fish, bird, and frog) from which many traditional origami animals are fashioned.<br><br>“All the parts of a base are linked together and can't be altered without affecting the rest of the paper, so that's the part you have to calculate just right,” Lang says. A base with four flaps is relatively easy to make. Each flap is formed from one of the corners of the square. Making a base with 17 flaps of the right size and in the right places—what you'd need to create Lang's flying rhinoceros beetle—is exponentially more difficult. “Figuring out how to make good legs was all people did for years,” Tom Hull says. “Doing a sixlegged beetle was a big, big deal.”<br><br>Lang resisted the challenge for a while. He spent most of the past two decades working as a laser physicist—first at Caltech, then later for private firms in Silicon Valley—and devoted his off-hours to origami. By 2002, his interest in origami won out. He quit his job and began folding paper for a living. Since then, he has created everything from a ruby-throated hummingbird to a full-scale human (commissioned for a German trade show). The jobs are sometimes banal—there's a lot of demand for cardboard fast-food containers that change shape—but every now and then Lang gets tapped for a more challenging project. He has been asked to simulate the folds of a car's air bag when packed into a steering column and to design a telescope lens that could be, shot into space, packed into a nine-foot cylinder and then unfurled to the size of a football field. He also recently consulted on the development of an origami-inspired medical implant, which he can't talk about other than to say that it was “big, permanent, and what keeps the person alive.” Origami also turns out to be useful for biological problems, such as determining how proteins fold in the body.be, shot into space, packed into a nine-foot cylinder and then unfurled to the size of a football field. He also recently consulted on the development of an origami-inspired medical implant, which he can't talk about other than to say that it was “big, permanent, and what keeps the person alive.” Origami also turns out to be useful for biological problems, such as determining how proteins fold in the body. <br><br>Over the past 15 years, Lang has been perfecting a program he wrote called TreeMaker, which can render a stick-figure sketch into a crease pattern—the web of lines that would be left if a finished piece of origami were unfolded and then smoothed. The software converts the sketch into a set of equations that calculate how the appendages of a complex animal form, like a deer, should be distributed on the paper in a way that ensures they will neatly emerge during folding without leaving excess paper or creating areas so wadded up that they can't be folded.<br><br>Calculating this, as mathematicians like to say when facing a daunting challenge, is not trivial. Fold a square piece of paper diagonally, then fold it in half, and the result will be a small isosceles triangle. Switch the order of those folds—in half first, then diagonally—and you end up with a squashed pentagon. The more folds a pattern has, the harder the problem of finding a folding sequence becomes. For one of his TreeMaker-guided designs—a life-size, anatomically correct Maine lobster—Lang was able to generate the crease pattern on the computer in just a few hours. Figuring out how to fold the 120-step pattern on a sheet of paper about 20 inches square took him almost two years.<br><br>“The mind-set to do advanced design is fragile,” Lang says soberly. “You have to hold all these complex surfaces in your mind and figure out how they interact. If you're pushing the edge of the envelope on something like this, you need total concentration. Sometimes you'll have 5, 10, 20 creases, and you have to make them all happen at once. You need to develop an intuition about it.”<br><br>To perfect their folding technique, Lang notes, rookies must also attend to details like not creasing folds too sharply. “Do that and your piece will end up looking tatty. Plus, if there's a point where a lot of those creases come together, the paper can burst. It just puts too much strain on the fibers."</div></div><div id="Language_Skills" class="question-details-Language-skill"><b>Type:&nbsp;</b> MCQ Single &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Marks:&nbsp;</b>  +1/-0 &nbsp;&nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Topic:&nbsp;</b> Verbal &gt; Reading Comprehension  &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Time Spent:&nbsp;</b><div>0 Mins 0 Secs</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-paper-number">14.&nbsp; </div> <div class="question-paper-question-text">Which of the following is NOT true of origami folds?</div></div><div class="question-paper-options"><div class="question-paper-option">A.&nbsp; Squash and petal folds yield a kite base.</div><div class="question-paper-option">B.&nbsp;The basic fold of origami are mountain and valley.</div><div class="question-paper-option">C.&nbsp;It's possible to blintz a petal fold.</div><div class="question-paper-option">D.&nbsp;The mountain fold stands up like a pup tent.</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-status-solution">Status : &nbsp;<div class="unanswered-answer">Unanswered</div></div></div><div class="question-paper-text-actual-solution"><b>Answer :  A</b></div><div class="solution"><div data-accordion-component="Accordion" class="accordion"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItem" class="accordion__item"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemHeading" role="heading" class="accordion__heading" aria-level="3"><div id="accordion__heading-13" aria-disabled="false" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accordion__panel-13" role="button" tabindex="0" class="accordion__button" data-accordion-component="AccordionItemButton"></div></div><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemPanel" class="accordion__panel" role="region" aria-labelledby="accordion__heading-13" id="accordion__panel-13" >The passage mentions that “a series of squash and petal folds yields a frog base”, making option (1) incorrect.</div></div></div></div><div class="bookmark-question"><button class="bookmark-button Button__StyledButton-sc-1o41kgk-0 hHWAHx" spacing="default" type="button"><span style="align-self: center; display: inline-flex; flex-wrap: nowrap; max-width: 100%; position: relative;"><span style="align-items: center; align-self: center; flex: 1 1 auto; margin: 0px 4px; max-width: 100%; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; transition: opacity 0.3s ease 0s; opacity: 1;"><span class="sc-iQKALj jOPeQg"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation"><path d="M12 16.373l3.98 2.193-.76-4.655 3.276-3.347-4.524-.69L12 5.687l-1.972 4.189-4.524.689L8.78 13.91l-.762 4.655L12 16.373zm0 2.283l-3.016 1.662a2 2 0 0 1-2.939-2.075l.599-3.656-2.57-2.624a2 2 0 0 1 1.129-3.377l3.47-.528 1.518-3.224a2 2 0 0 1 3.618 0l1.519 3.224 3.47.528a2 2 0 0 1 1.127 3.377l-2.569 2.624.599 3.656a2 2 0 0 1-2.94 2.075L12 18.656z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></span>Bookmark</span></span></button><button class="bookmark-button Button__StyledButton-sc-1o41kgk-0 hHWAHx" spacing="default" type="button"><span style="align-self: center; display: inline-flex; flex-wrap: nowrap; max-width: 100%; position: relative;"><span style="align-items: center; align-self: center; flex: 1 1 auto; margin: 0px 4px; max-width: 100%; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; transition: opacity 0.3s ease 0s; opacity: 1;"><span class="sc-iQKALj jOPeQg"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation"><path d="M6 12.235v6.446c0 .537.45.977 1 .977s1-.44 1-.977v-5.778c1.17-.341 2.389-.045 3.768.29.982.238 2.036.495 3.13.495a5.73 5.73 0 0 0 2.547-.567 1 1 0 0 0 .563-.9V5.466a.998.998 0 0 0-1.437-.9c-1.345.654-2.731.317-4.331-.071-1.729-.42-3.687-.895-5.678.072A1 1 0 0 0 6 5.466v6.769zm3.111-1.48c1.094 0 2.148.256 3.129.495 1.381.335 2.6.63 3.768.289V6.836c-1.488.27-2.93-.08-4.24-.398-1.379-.335-2.598-.632-3.768-.29v4.704a6.195 6.195 0 0 1 1.111-.097z" fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></span> Share question feedback</span></span></button></div><hr></div><div class="question-div-paper"><div class="passage-details"><div class="passage-header"><b> Passage :</b></div><div class="passage-header"><p>Read the following passage and answer the given questions.<br>
<br>
Activity in the services sector shrank in September as new orders sank, a new survey shows. To add to the worries, overall economic activity is seen to be nearly stagnating while employment levels fell for the second successive month.<br>
<br>
The seasonally adjusted Service Sector Business Activity index fell to 49.8 from 53.8 in August, HSBC Purchasing Managers Index, which is based on a survey of 350 private sector executives, showed. Any reading of less than 50 indicates contraction, while economic activity is seen to be growing if the index is over 50. This is the first time since April 2009 that the services sector, that accounts for more than half the Indian economy, has slipped into negative terrain.<br>
<br>
The decline in services sector activity could be attributed to lower demand for offshoring and IT and IT-enabled services from the US and Europe, where several economies are grappling with debt problems. There is also an impact on financial services as banking activity has slowed down on account of higher interest rates and investors are wary of parking their funds in stock markets.<br>
<br>
At the moment, manufacturing activity is continuing to grow, though at a much slower pace. As a result, the HSBC India Composite Index- which covers manufacturing and services sectors- stood at 50.2 in September, compared to 54.5 in August.<br>
<br>
The overall trend is in line with expectations that the Indian economy will grow at less than 8% during the current financial year, with agriculture providing the only silver lining. Last year the economy expanded 8.5% prompting the government to predict 9% growth this year. But over the last few months, as the global economic situation deteriorated and higher interest rates slowed down the tempo, the government too is lowering its forecasts although not to the extent that others have done.<br>
<br>
But it isn't just services which are shrinking. The survey shows employment fell for the second successive month, increasing worries for policymakers, who want rapid economic growth to take care of the growing population that is joining the workforce.<br>
<br>
Typically, a near-stagnant economy will encourage the central bank to start lowering interest rates to spur economic activity. But given the inflationary pressures, RBI is in no mood to do so and the debate is whether it will resort to further rate hikes or pause after increasing key policy rates a dozen times over the last 19 months. It is due to review its monetary policy later this month. The HSBC survey showed that inflation pressures are firmly in place though the rate is moderating a little. "We are getting close to the end of RBI's tightening cycle, but we are not quite there yet," an economist observed.</p>

It is due to review its monetary policy later this month. The HSBC survey showed that inflation pressures are firmly in place though the rate is moderating a little. "We are getting close to the end of RBI's tightening cycle, but we are not quite there yet," an economist observed.</p>

<br>
Activity in the services sector shrank in September as new orders sank, a new survey shows. To add to the worries, overall economic activity is seen to be nearly stagnating while employment levels fell for the second successive month.<br>
<br>
The seasonally adjusted Service Sector Business Activity index fell to 49.8 from 53.8 in August, HSBC Purchasing Managers Index, which is based on a survey of 350 private sector executives, showed. Any reading of less than 50 indicates contraction, while economic activity is seen to be growing if the index is over 50. This is the first time since April 2009 that the services sector, that accounts for more than half the Indian economy, has slipped into negative terrain.<br>
<br>
The decline in services sector activity could be attributed to lower demand for offshoring and IT and IT-enabled services from the US and Europe, where several economies are grappling with debt problems. There is also an impact on financial services as banking activity has slowed down on account of higher interest rates and investors are wary of parking their funds in stock markets.<br>
<br>
At the moment, manufacturing activity is continuing to grow, though at a much slower pace. As a result, the HSBC India Composite Index- which covers manufacturing and services sectors- stood at 50.2 in September, compared to 54.5 in August.<br>
<br>
The overall trend is in line with expectations that the Indian economy will grow at less than 8% during the current financial year, with agriculture providing the only silver lining. Last year the economy expanded 8.5% prompting the government to predict 9% growth this year. But over the last few months, as the global economic situation deteriorated and higher interest rates slowed down the tempo, the government too is lowering its forecasts although not to the extent that others have done.<br>
<br>
But it isn't just services which are shrinking. The survey shows employment fell for the second successive month, increasing worries for policymakers, who want rapid economic growth to take care of the growing population that is joining the workforce.<br>
<br>
Typically, a near-stagnant economy will encourage the central bank to start lowering interest rates to spur economic activity. But given the inflationary pressures, RBI is in no mood to do so and the debate is whether it will resort to further rate hikes or pause after increasing key policy rates a dozen times over the last 19 months.
