The French Revolution created a vision for a new moral universe: that sovereignty resides in nations; that a constitution and the rule of law govern politics; that people are equal and enjoy inalienable rights; and that church and state should be separate.<br>B. The French Revolution invented modern revolution —the idea that humans can transform the world according to a plan—and so has a central place in the study of the social sciences.<br>C. It ushered in modernity by destroying the foundations of the “Old Regime”—absolutist politics, legal inequality, a “feudal” economy (characterized by guilds, manorialism, and even serfdom), and an alliance of church and state.<br>D. That vision is enshrined in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789, whose proclamation of “natural, imprescriptible, and inalienable” rights served as the model for the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<br>        A.

During the 24-hour darkness of the austral autumn and winter, the South Pole Telescope operates nonstop under impeccable conditions for astronomy.<br>B. The atmosphere is thin (the pole is more than 9,300 feet above sea level, 9,000 of which are ice), stable (due to the absence of the heating and cooling effects of a rising and setting Sun) and the pole has some of the calmest winds on Earth, blowing almost always from the same direction.<br>C. “The South Pole has the harshest environment on Earth, but also the most benign,” says William Holzapfel, a University of California at Berkeley astrophysicist, the on-site lead researcher at the South Pole Telescope.<br>D. From an astronomer’s perspective, not until the Sun goes down and stays down—March through September— does the South Pole get “benign.”<br>        A. ABCD        B. CDBA        C. CDAB        D.

Nor will Chinese, Russian, or Indian culture soon shoulder aside the American version-high or low- whose draw is embodied by Harvard and Hollywood.<br>C. Once a standard exists, it tends to perpetuate itself-just like the dollar, for all its ups and downs will not soon yield to the Euro or the Renminbi.<br>D.

The oldest fossil grasses are just 70 million years old, although grass may have evolved a bit earlier than that.<br>B.

Nevertheless, the focus of otherwise very different movements - from cultural feminism to environmentalism to radical jihadism - is fundamentally the same: moral regulation.<br>B. Identity politics constantly demands the creation of new identities and lifestyle groups, often hostile to one another.<br>C. The main beneficiary of this shift from explicit political clashes to new forms of culture war has been identity politics.<br>D. Many of the political battles of the past two decades have actually been battles over cultural values, be it marriage, family, sexuality, abortion, immigration, multiculturalism, Islam or the EU.</span></li></ol><ol class="c0 lst-kix_kuoss2pju452-1 start" start="1"><li class="c6"><span class="c2">BACD                B.

The bloody upheavals and wars occurred not in Europe, America or Russia, but in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, and were either directly or indirectly a response to the experience of Western colonialism.<br>C. Despite the aggressive rhetoric of this era, the Cold War was a period of relative peace between hostile geopolitical blocs.<br>D.

The Mandate of Heaven indicated divine approval of a king’s right to rule.<br>B. In other words, the Mandate of Heaven gave divine ruling authority to kings that lived a moral life, administered justice, and protected the welfare of his people.<br>C. Whereas Medieval Europeans legitimized their ruling authority by the divine right of kings, Confucian societies used a similar concept called the Mandate of Heaven.<br>D.

Upon his arrival in Kaesŏng, General Yi toppled the government through a military coup and in 1392 CE, he placed himself on the throne —ushering in the Chosŏn Kingdom.<br>C. Due to his prominence in 1388 CE, the anti-Ming (pro-Mongol) faction sent General Yi to expel a contingent of Ming troops stationed on the northern part of the Korean Peninsula.<br>D.

That entailed helping the weaker side in order to promote a regional balance of power and preventing the rise of a regional power, or at least reducing its impact on British security and interests.<br>C. Creating a balance of power and fostering regional stability could help to realize commercial goals; hence these became the core of the British Empire’s strategy.<br>D.

Flight safety has so far focused on threats from the passenger side, and the 9/11 terror episode led to fortification of the cockpit.<br>C. But if they are in a position to act, pilots can override this mechanism.<br>D.

Indeed, Indian policy-planners find themselves in a predicament thanks to the continued monetary easing by some nations and the shrinkage in world trade.<br>B. In this context, a fund-starved country like India will do well to focus on foreign direct investment rather than get unduly worried about foreign institutional investment, which will have its ebb and flow depending on the environment outside..<br>C.

	<p class="c2">Q4. This paragraph is focuses how set standards and “operating systems” tend to perpetuate, adding to the influence of the country that sets it. Sentence B starts with a “nor”, so we should ideally have an example preceding this. It is clear that only sentence C which talks of the dollar not being easily replaceable by other currencies fits the bill. So we have the order CB_. Of the given answer options, only 1 and 3 have this pattern. We can see D completes the paragraph. Should the paragraph start with sentence A or C? Sentence A is an example of how standards perpetuate. Sentence C starts off stating the premise of the paragraph, and continues the thought with an example. Hence C is a better sentence to start the paragraph than A. The question is &quot; Arrange the sentences in the correct order &quot; The order is CBAD. Hence, the answer is CBAD. Choice C is the correct answer. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c2"></span></p>
	
	<br><br>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c2">Q6..We see straight away that there is a link between sentences C and B, both talking of &quot;identity politics&quot;. It is also clear that C comes before B. Let’s consider Sentence D. It talks of how battles over cultural values dominate politics. Sentence C talks of the main beneficiary of the “shift from explicit political clashes” to “culture war”. So it is clear that C follows D Sentence A concludes the paragraph with “moral regulation” being the common goal of these otherwise different movements. The question is &quot; Arrange the sentences in the correct order &quot; The order is DCBA. Hence, the answer is DCBA. Choice C is the correct answer. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c2"></span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c2">Q14. At the outset, both sentences A and B seem to offer a good choice to start the paragraph. Sentence C states that if they are in a position to act, pilots can override “this mechanism”. What can the mechanism refer to? The obvious answer is the code that opens the cockpit door discussed in sentence D. So C follows D. Sentence D refers to exceptional circumstances when access to the cockpit can be obtained. Both situations discussed to here assume that the cockpit is no longer commandeered from within- i.e when the emergency affects the pilot or cockpit area, the crew can use a code to gain access. When the pilots are immobilized, the doors open automatically. Sentence A refers to the search for a solution to the problem of access to the cockpit when the plane is still commandeered from within. So A follows D. However, we also know that C follows D. Considering sentences A and C, it is clear C is a better choice to immediately follow D than A, as it refers to the mechanism of overriding access to the cockpit. Consider sentence B. This talks of flight safety efforts being focused on threats from the passenger side, leading to fortification of the cockpit. Sentence D talks of the exceptional circumstances when the fortified cockpit can be accessed. So D follows B. The question is &quot; Arrange the sentences in the correct order &quot; The order is BDCA. Hence, the answer is BDCA. Choice D is the correct answer.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c2"></span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c2">Q16. Sentence A declares that comments can turn a website into a democratic “polyphony”. Sentence C elaborates on this. Sentence B talks of the danger of “it” descending to cacophony if the language does not befit a “matured public sphere”. “It” here refers to the debates talked of in sentence C. Sentence D provides a solution to the problem addressed in sentence B. Moderators must retain the space for debate, while rejecting voices that breed cacophony. The question is &quot; Arrange the sentences in the correct order &quot; The order is ACBD. Hence, the answer is ACBD. Choice D is the correct answer. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c2"></span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c2">Q17. Sentence C introduces the “right to be forgotten”, so it is likely to be the first sentence of the paragraph. It says that Europeans, under this right, are allowed to ask search engines to delist certain links from search results. Sentence A also talks of delisted links. It explains that delisted links are no longer readily available to the public through a simple search. So A follows C. Sentences B and D offer contrasting views on the right to be forgotten. Whilst sentence D voices the concerns of campaigners of freedom of expression, sentence B talks of the stance of the supporters. B follows D. The question is &quot; Arrange the sentences in the correct order &quot; The order is CADB. Hence, the answer is CADB. Choice A is the correct answer. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c2"></span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c2">Q19. Let’s start by looking at what the best sentence to start the paragraph is. There are only 2 options- sentence C and sentence D. Of these, sentence C defines what sortition is- it is democracy on the basis of drafting by lot. Sentence D on the other hand explains what this involves. So C is the starting sentence of the paragraph, and it is followed by D, possibly immediately. Sentence D talks about a random sample of the population being drafted to understand the problem and take a sensible decision on what to do. Between A and B, which is the better choice to follow D? Sentence B is, as it shed further light on how sortition is practiced: those who are drafted are exposed to expert opinion, objective information and public debate so that they can take an informed decision. So B follows D. Sentence A concludes the paragraph by stating the benefits of this form of democracy. The question is &quot; Arrange the sentences in the correct order &quot; The order is CDBA. Hence, the answer is CDBA. Choice A is the correct answer. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c2"></span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c2">Q22. The link between sentences B and D is easy to spot. Sentence B talks of the situation twenty years ago, when athletes could do as they pleased and the nightly news featured only “monumental” dustups. Sentence D talks of the situation today: athletes have signed up for “24 hour a day news conference” on the social media. Clearly, D follows B.   Sentence A states that while they may not be role models, athletes are certainly “digital lighting rods” i.e. they attract a lot of criticism, which may not quite be justified. This idea ties in with the one made by sentence D, that athletes are being monitored by the social media round the clock.   Sentence C says that while athletes may want the freedom to speak freely without damaging their paychecks, “that’s not how it works”. Again, we see that sentence C refers to the constant scrutiny the social media subjects athletes to.   In terms of sentence ordering, it makes sense to start the paragraph with B (how athletes could get away with doing what they wanted earlier, unless the news was “monumental”), then D (how they are closely monitored today) and then C, as C tells us that though they would prefer to express themselves freely without hurting their paychecks, that’s now how it works today. Sentence A sums up the present day situation: athletes may not be role models, but they’re certainly digital lightning rods.   The question is &quot; Arrange the sentences in the correct order &quot; The order is BDCA. Hence, the answer is BDCA. Choice A is the correct answer.   </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c2"></span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c2">Q23. Sentence A states that the current melting of ice in Greenland is causing “the tilt” to change at a rate of 2.6 cm a year. Let us look at the other sentences to see what “the tilt” refers to. We see that sentence C clarifies this. Sentence C tells us that “the Earth’s orbital tilt” varies between 22 and 25 degrees very 41,000 years. There is however, no cogent link between sentences A and C. We can just say at this point that A follows C, but not immediately after.   Now sentence D begins with “in other words” and states that while an orbital tilt causes climate change, current changes in climate could end up causing changes in the Earth&#39;s axial tilt. Which sentence is sentence D paraphrasing? The only and obvious choice is sentence B, which says that though a natural event could bring about climate change, scientists are warning of a possibility for “reverse feedback”. So D follows B.   What is the “natural event” referred to in sentence B? The melting of ice in Greenland, or the variation in the Earth’s orbital tilt? Clearly, it is the latter. So B follows C.   The point about the melting of ice in Greenland changing the tilt is made to substantiate the theory that climate change can cause the Earth’s axial tilt to change.   The question is &quot; Arrange the sentences in the correct order &quot; The order is CBDA Hence, the answer is CBDA Choice C is the correct answer. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c2"></span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c2">Q24. Sentence A is the best choice for starting the paragraph, as it introduces the novel, ‘War and Peace’. All other sentences refer to “it” or “this ceaseless ebb and flow of life”, requiring some explanation beforehand.   Now, sentence A tells us that “one of the beauties” of the novel is that it does not end when the war ends. Sentence B tells us when the novel ends instead. So B looks like a good choice to follow A.   Sentence C talks of “this ceaseless ebb and flow of life”. What does this refer to? We find the answer in sentence B, which talks of the novel concluding when the hero settles down to a boring routine after war. So C follows immediately after B.   Now where does sentence D fit in? Both sentences B and D talk about the novel’s conclusion. Sentence D declares that concluding the novel at the “moment of heroic drama” would have “destroyed its integrity”. And sentence B tells us how the novel ends. Clearly, D does not follow the sentence group BC, for it makes no sense to refer to the conclusion of the novel again, after it has been discussed in sentence B and followed up with C. Sentence D fits in the paragraph best when it is placed immediately after A and before BC. So we have sentence A talking of how the conclusion of &#39;War and Peace&#39; is &quot;one of its beauties&quot;, followed by sentence D, which argues that concluding it at &quot;the moment of heroic drama&quot; would have compromised the integrity of the novel, followed by sentence B, which tells us how the novel ends and sentence C which talks of how this conveys the ceaseless ebb and flow of life.   The question is &quot; Arrange the sentences in the correct order &quot; The order is ADBC Hence, the answer is ADBC Choice C is the correct answer. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c2"></span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c2">Q25. There are only two options for the sentence to begin the paragraph with- sentence A and sentence C. Of these, we see that C makes a reference to “that evidence”, without explaining what it is. So we rule out sentence C as the first sentence of the paragraph. So the paragraph starts with sentence A.   Now sentence A declares that Darwin did not discover the idea that species evolved or a model of evolution in the Galapagos islands. So what did he discover there? Sentence D answers this and states that he found a naturally occurring laboratory that helped him study and make a model of evolution, the first supported by real evidence. So D follows A.   We see that sentence C too mentions ‘evidence’. It elaborates the idea in sentence D, describing the islands of the Galapagos as “perfect petri dishes” for generating the evidence Darwin needed. So C follows A.   Sentence A, the last sentence, concludes the paragraph by stating that Darwin’s ability to see “this fact” — the Galapagos as petri dishes generating the evidence to support his model— is the reason why we remember him today.   The question is &quot; Arrange the sentences in the correct order &quot; The order is ADCB Hence, the answer is ADCB Choice A is the correct answer. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c2"></span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c2">Q27. By timeline, 8500 BC was before 5000 BC. So sentence C is likely to feature after sentence D in the paragraph.   Sentence D talks of cultivation of plants and domestication of animals that began in the Near East around 8500 BC. Sentence A carries this idea forward, explaining how fixed settlements and small towns came into being after people turned to farming.   Sentence B starts off with “their labors”. Who does “their” refer to? Sentence C, which talks of farmers who moved down to the river valleys of Mesopotamia and their efforts to build dykes and ditches, has the answer. So B follows C.   DACB makes a cogent paragraph.   The question is &quot; Arrange the sentences in the correct order &quot; The order is DACB Hence, the answer is DACB Choice A is the correct answer. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c2"></span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c2">Q28. The given starting sentence for the paragraph tells us that the ISRO has successfully launched a weather satellite using a GSLV carrying indigenous cryogenic technology.   Now, we see that sentences B and C are about the scientific challenges involved in accomplishing this task. Sentence B starts with “likewise…”, which naturally means that this sentence follows C. So we have the sequence CB.   Sentence A states that “the September 8 GSLV launch” is the “third consecutive success” and goes on to talk about the significance of the launch for India. It seems to be a good option to follow the starting sentence given.   However, we find that it is tricky to place sentence D. Sentence D declares that “this” is a departure from “the long history of failures with the GSLV” and goes on to state that, on the other hand, every launch of the PSLV, “the workhorse of the ISRO” has been a success. What does “this” refer to? The successful launch of the GSLV. Both the starting sentence that is given as well as sentence A talk about the successful launch of the GSLV. But it does not make sense to refer to the history of failures of the GSLV, and indeed the success of the PSLV, after sentence A, which emphasizes how important the September 8 GSLV success is for India.   On the other hand, if we place sentence D right after the starting sentence and then follow it up with sentence A, we see that the paragraph makes more sense. The first sentence talks of the successful launch, then sentence D talks of how this is a departure from the history of failures for the GSLV, which has had a less successful record than PSLV till now, followed by sentence A which talks of the significance of this successful GSLV launch. So we have the sequence DA to follow the starting line.   We have already seen that CB is a sequence. So the correct order is DACB.   The question is &quot; Arrange the sentences in the correct order &quot; The order is DACB Hence, the answer is DACB Choice B is the correct answer. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c2"></span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c2">Q29. Sentence A refers to a “victory”. What victory? Sentences B and D seem to provide an answer. Sentence B talks of the Greek warriors in the Battle of Marathon while sentence D is a more general statement about Athenian warriors routing Persian invaders. So, both sentences A and B are likely to follow D. Which of these sentences comes immediately after D? Sentence A states that not long after the victory, the Greeks already began to look back at it and think that they could never match this past glory. This does make sense when placed immediately after D. Now, consider sentence B. It talks of the Marathonomachai warriors who fought the war being regarded as Athens’ Greatest Generation. This too, looks like a good option to follow D. So, we need to look at some other clues to help us finalize the sentence order.   Sentences B and C make references to time. B talks of the 490 BCE war and C, of the mid- fifth century BCE (around 450 BCE). Note that in terms of timeline, B precedes C.   Now, C talks of Athenians “looking back with longing”. To what? D provides an answer: a few decades earlier, Athenian citizen-soldiers had helped to rout the Persian invaders of Greece. So, D follows C.   If A were to follow D, we cannot place B in the paragraph. However, the sentence order BA does make sense after CD. So, the correct order is CDBA.   The question is &quot; Arrange the sentences in the correct order &quot; The order is CDBA Hence, the answer is CDBA Choice D is the correct answer.   </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c2"></span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c2">Q34. Both A and C are contenders for the first sentence of the paragraph.   We see that D explains the word ‘meltdown’ mentioned in A. So, D follows A.   B talks of a ‘short-term emergency painkiller’. What does this refer to? The emergency liquidity provided by the world’s leading central banks in 2008, that is mentioned in A. So, B too follows A.   Which of these is a better fit immediately after A? D is, as it explains what would have happened if the emergency liquidity wasn’t provided at that time. Also note that D uses the same tense as A, in explaining what ‘would have’ happened.   So, we have the order ADB.   Consider sentence C. Though both A and B make sense after C, we already know that ADB is a unit. So CADB is the right order. The question is &quot; Arrange the sentences in the correct order &quot; The order is CADB Hence, the answer is CADB Choice B is the correct answer.   </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c2"></span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c2">Q35. Sentences A and C are both contenders for the first sentence of the paragraph.   The example given in B fits both A and C well.   BD is a link, as D relates to Facebook employees&#39; concern relating to the censorship tool built by the company.   However, A doesn&#39;t make sense after C, or C after A, as both these are general statements and do not logically follow from one another.   So, we have two possibilities-- ABDC or CBDA.   Now, if A were to be the first sentence of the paragraph, does C conclude it well? Sentence A questions the means followed in the name of the mission to make &quot;the world more open and connected&quot;. The unit BD gives an example to support this. The main idea here is that it is time to ponder over &quot;what mission you&#39;re really serving&quot; when you have reached the point of compromising on the very idea on which the grand mission is based. Sentence C, however, does not conclude this paragraph well, as it lays the emphasis on grand ends &quot;making it easy&quot; to justify unsavory means. This is an idea that is implicit in sentence A.   On the other hand, if C were to be the first sentence, the main idea of the paragraph is that having &quot;grand&quot; ends makes it easy for a company to justify unsavory means. The Facebook example in the unit BD supports this. Sentence D states the argument by Zuckerberg that being part of any conversation is good, even if it&#39;s &quot;not yet the full conversation&quot;. Sentence A points out the elephant in the room-- that the company is enabling censorship by an authoritarian regime in the name of making the world more &quot;open&quot;.   In terms of flow of ideas CBDA is a much better order than ABDC. So, CBDA is the right order.   The question is &quot; Arrange the sentences in the correct order &quot; The order is CBDA Hence, the answer is CBDA Choice D is the correct answer.   </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c2"></span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c2">Q41. Of the given sentences, both A and D relate to the vibrations produced by elephants as they trumpet. Sentence A describes how the high-frequency vibrations travel in air, and D, how low frequencies travel through the ground. D follows A.   Consider sentence B. What does this relate to? B could follow C, as it adds to the idea of a &quot;two-tiered communication model&quot; providing an effective way of sending messages to herd members and rival herds. Equally, B could follow D. The fact that low frequency vibrations travel through the ground is useful in the jungle, where there is dense vegetation.   So, let us consider the order CBAD. This does not make a cogent paragraph, as it is not clear from the first sentence-- C --what the &quot;herd members&quot; or &quot;distant herds&quot; refer to. Also, B, which follows C, does not explain what the herd referred to in C is. The transition from B to AD is abrupt.   On the other hand, ADBC sounds more natural. A and D describe how elephants communicate in high and low frequency vibrations, B explains how this is useful in a jungle, and C adds to B, summing up the paragraph. When arranged this way, there is no ambiguity in what the &#39;herd&#39; refers to. So, this is the right order.   The question is &quot; Arrange the sentences in the correct order &quot; The order is ADCB Hence, the answer is ADCB Choice A is the correct answer.   </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c2"></span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c2">Q43. Sentences B and C relate to Sans Forgetica. Of these, B is the one that introduces us to Sans Forgetica, describing it as a &quot;new font&quot;. So, B precedes C.   Now, B states that Sans Forgetica has been &quot;based on this idea&quot;. What could this idea be? D provides the answer: people remember things better when they have to overcome some minor obstacles while processing information. So, B follows D.   Consider A. It states that the reader&#39;s mind tries to complete &quot;the shapes&quot;. It is not clear from the unit DB what these shapes are. However, C, which describes Sans Forgetica as a font with &quot;intermittent gaps in each letter&quot; clarifies what A refers to. Sans Forgetica has letters with intermittent gaps in them. While reading this font, the reader&#39;s mind seeks to complete the shapes. So, A follows C.   Putting these together, we see that DBCA is the right order.   The question is &quot; Arrange the sentences in the correct order &quot; The order is DBCA Hence, the answer is DBCA Choice B is the correct answer. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c2"></span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c2">Q44. For the first sentence of the paragraph, we have two contenders—A and C. Both these sentences relate to debt build-up in households during the financial crisis. Of these, C is more general, and talks of the build-up of debt in households and in non-financial firms as &quot;a crucial aspect&quot; of the 2008 financial crisis. Sentence A carries this idea forward—the rise in private debt led to a drop in household consumption, which, in turn, was a key driver of the recession. So, A follows C.   Both B and D relate to the lack of regulatory control during the crisis. D states that regulatory failure was the principal cause of the crisis. B adds to this, stating that there are two aspects to this regulatory failure—(a) the lack of regulatory control over the growth in credit, and (b) the lack of regulatory control over flow of credit into real estate. So, B follows D.   The flow of ideas from A to D is also smooth. While a drop in household consumption resulted in recession, there is no doubt that regulatory failure was the principal cause of the crisis.   CADB is the right order.   The question is &quot; Arrange the sentences in the correct order &quot; The order is CADB Hence, the answer is CADB Choice C is the correct answer.   </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c2"></span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c2">Q47. Sentence A is about 17th-century Amsterdam, and how it was a common for guilds to commission portraits of themselves &quot;in their uniforms, holding weapons&quot;. D, on the other hand, talks of a famous painting by Rembrandt, called The Night Watch. Now, it is clear that Rembrandt&#39;s painting is the main focus of the paragraph, as the rest of the sentences relate to the painting. So, D is likely to be the first sentence of the paragraph.   C begins with &quot;its status and...&quot;. The pronoun &#39;its&#39; here refers to the painting. As D is the only sentence with the painting as the subject, C follows immediately after D.   C states that the reason why the painting became critically acclaimed had nothing to do with it being a painting of a civic guard group. Sentence A explains why: it was common for guilds to commission portraits of themselves in 17th-century Amsterdam. So, A follows C.   Finally, B follows A, explaining how Rembrandt transformed a commonplace commission into a masterpiece.   So, DCAB is the right order.   The question is &quot; Arrange the sentences in the correct order &quot; The order is DCAB Hence, the answer is DCAB Choice D is the correct answer. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c2"></span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c2">Q48. Of the given sentences, B is the only one that could be the first sentence of the paragraph, as sentences A and D talk of &quot;losing&quot; without explaining the context, and C starts with &quot;such behaviour&quot; and needs some information to precede it.   B explains that the stakes of political competition &quot;heighten dramatically&quot; when parties think of each other as mortal enemies.   Now, both A and D talk of a possible outcome of this political competition: losing. Between these two, D comes first, as it explains how losing, a normal outcome, becomes a &quot;catastrophe&quot; when the stakes of political competition are thought to be high. Sentence A adds to this, explaining the effect of a high perceived cost of losing. So, A follows D.   A is the only sentence that describes any kind of behaviour--the attempt to abandon forbearance and play constitutional hardball. C, naturally, follows A.   So, BDAC is the right order.   The question is &quot; Arrange the sentences in the correct order &quot; The order is BDAC Hence, the answer is BDAC Choice A is the correct answer. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c2"></span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c2">Q49. There are two possible sentences to start the paragraph: A and C. Of these, A, which states that the metric system was created during the French Revolution, is more general. C states the reason behind the creation of the system and makes a reference to &#39;the old regime&#39;. This makes sense only when C follows A. So, A is the first sentence of the paragraph.   D starts off with &#39;at this time&#39;. The time referred to here is the time of the French Revolution. The only sentence which talks of the time of the French Revolution is A. So, D follows immediately after A. During the time of the French revolution, the ideology of liberty, equality, fraternity was embraced by scientists as well.   D leads on to C, which explains how scientists with the new ideology tried to create a metric system to liberate the common man from the inconsistent weights and measures of the old regime.   Now, B starts off stating that &#39;it&#39; was a utopian project. Clearly, the pronoun &#39;it&#39; here refers to the metric system. The only sentence with the metric system as the subject is C. B adds to C, explaining why the creators of the metric system wanted that a shared system of weights and measures: they thought that it would allow for the free exchange of goods and information. So, B follows C.   So, ADCB is the right order.   The question is &quot; Arrange the sentences in the correct order &quot; The order is ADCB Hence, the answer is ADCB Choice B is the correct answer.</span></p>
