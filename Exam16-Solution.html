It was possible to conceive of outcomes on the basis of government spending between 1947 and 1985 when the public sector made up more than half the gross domestic product. Now that is neither possible nor desirable. The private sector accounts for three-fourths of the gross domestic product, reducing the role of public expenditure in meeting growth targets.

It should be reconceived as a think tank that works at maximizing outcomes from investments in social and physical infrastructure by identifying problems of governance. Outcomes in health and education are crucial to realize the potential of our billion-plus population, while shortcomings in power and port handling facilities can hold up future growth. Where public-private partnerships involve a number of government agencies, the Commission can work as a nodal body that takes a larger view of projects and ensures their smooth implementation.<br>Planners should aim at meeting growth targets by ensuring that markets function efficiently. They can advise the government on market specific policies that address lack of access to information. They can identify sunrise areas in the next decade and promote research and innovation through public-private partnership. Simultaneously, planners should explore markets for products made by unskilled workers.<br>The Eleventh Plan aims at 9 per cent 'inclusive' growth by raising investment in infrastructure from 5 per cent of GDP to 9 per cent. Of the $475 billion investment needed for infrastructure, $130–140 billion is expected to come from the private sector. Public sector enterprises are expected to raise resources internally, with the Plan proposing lower support for them. The Plan has got its priorities right by reducing support for PSEs and increasing social sector allocations. Education is a big-ticket item, with the Planning Commission earmarking Rs. 2,75,289 crore for it alone with a view to meeting the skills shortage. Sadly, health has not been given the same emphasis.

Of late, there have been consistent efforts by both New Delhi and Tokyo to transform this economic momentum into a "special strategic and global partnership". Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's three-day visit to India this month, during which both sides agreed to major deals, including the introduction of Japan's bullet train technology in India and an agreement on nuclear partnership, clearly sets the stage for elevated bilateral ties in the future. The potential of Indo-Japanese economic partnership is huge. Despite India being one the world's largest economies, it accounts for only about 1 per cent of Japan's imports, exports and direct investments abroad. The proposed bullet train link between Mumbai and Ahmedabad, which will have access to a soft Japanese loan of $12-15 billion at a concessional interest rate of 0.1 per cent, will cement economic cooperation further. Besides, this suits well the Prime Minister's agenda of building quality infrastructure in the country. The civil nuclear cooperation deal, after five years of talks, marks a complete reversal of the policy Japan adopted towards India after the Pokhran nuclear tests in May 1998. Tokyo, which considers itself a champion of non-proliferation, had suspended much of its aid after India's nuclear test. The deal, however, can be seen as a Japanese seal of approval to India's status as a nuclear-armed state. <br><br>To be sure, enhanced economic and energy cooperation will benefit both countries. Japan has capital and skill whereas India has huge untapped potential. What they need is a clear road map, which, as the recent official exchanges show, is in the works. But at the same time, India should be wary of the great game going on in Asia. It may not be a coincidence that Japan is shedding its historical pacifist foreign policy, which helped its rise as an economic giant in Asia, at a time when its tensions with China are on the rise and the United States has been "pivoting" towards Asia. The American strategy appears to be to build an alliance in Asia to contain the rise of China. Japan, Washington's strongest ally in Asia, is obviously one of the pillars of this "pivot" strategy. It is hardly a secret that both the American and Japanese establishments want India to "swing" towards their alliance. Mr. Abe had earlier written about the strategic need to forge a "democratic security diamond" with the U.S., Australia and India. This is the challenge India's policymakers would face while deepening the country's partnership with Japan further. New Delhi should get its economic and strategic priorities right and state them clearly. To script its own rise, India should build strong ties with each power, instead of aligning with any particular bloc. The country will gain more from everybody's rise rather than joining some geopolitical alliance that is not in its primary interest.<br></div></div><div id="Language_Skills" class="question-details-Language-skill"><b>Type:&nbsp;</b> MCQ Single &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Marks:&nbsp;</b>  +3/-0 &nbsp;&nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Topic:&nbsp;</b> Verbal &gt; Reading Comprehension  &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Time Spent:&nbsp;</b><div>0 Mins 0 Secs</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-paper-number">5.&nbsp; </div> <div class="question-paper-question-text">Since how long has Japan been investing in India's infrastructure sector?</div></div><div class="question-paper-options"><div class="question-paper-option">A.&nbsp; In the recent past</div><div class="question-paper-option">B.&nbsp; Since the 1980s.</div><div class="question-paper-option">C.&nbsp; Since the beginning of this century.</div><div class="question-paper-option">D.&nbsp;For a long time.</div><div class="question-paper-option">E.&nbsp; None of the above</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-status-solution">Status : &nbsp;<div class="unanswered-answer">Unanswered</div></div></div><div class="question-paper-text-actual-solution"><b>Answer :  D</b></div><div class="solution"><div data-accordion-component="Accordion" class="accordion"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItem" class="accordion__item"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemHeading" role="heading" class="accordion__heading" aria-level="3"><div id="accordion__heading-4" aria-disabled="false" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accordion__panel-4" role="button" tabindex="0" class="accordion__button" data-accordion-component="AccordionItemButton"></div></div><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemPanel" class="accordion__panel" role="region" aria-labelledby="accordion__heading-4" id="accordion__panel-4" >Refer to the first sentence of the passage for the answer.</div></div></div></div><div class="bookmark-question"><button class="bookmark-button Button__StyledButton-sc-1o41kgk-0 hHWAHx" spacing="default" type="button"><span style="align-self: center; display: inline-flex; flex-wrap: nowrap; max-width: 100%; position: relative;"><span style="align-items: center; align-self: center; flex: 1 1 auto; margin: 0px 4px; max-width: 100%; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; transition: opacity 0.3s ease 0s; opacity: 1;"><span class="sc-iQKALj jOPeQg"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation"><path d="M12 16.373l3.98 2.193-.76-4.655 3.276-3.347-4.524-.69L12 5.687l-1.972 4.189-4.524.689L8.78 13.91l-.762 4.655L12 16.373zm0 2.283l-3.016 1.662a2 2 0 0 1-2.939-2.075l.599-3.656-2.57-2.624a2 2 0 0 1 1.129-3.377l3.47-.528 1.518-3.224a2 2 0 0 1 3.618 0l1.519 3.224 3.47.528a2 2 0 0 1 1.127 3.377l-2.569 2.624.599 3.656a2 2 0 0 1-2.94 2.075L12 18.656z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></span>Bookmark</span></span></button><button class="bookmark-button Button__StyledButton-sc-1o41kgk-0 hHWAHx" spacing="default" type="button"><span style="align-self: center; display: inline-flex; flex-wrap: nowrap; max-width: 100%; position: relative;"><span style="align-items: center; align-self: center; flex: 1 1 auto; margin: 0px 4px; max-width: 100%; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; transition: opacity 0.3s ease 0s; opacity: 1;"><span class="sc-iQKALj jOPeQg"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation"><path d="M6 12.235v6.446c0 .537.45.977 1 .977s1-.44 1-.977v-5.778c1.17-.341 2.389-.045 3.768.29.982.238 2.036.495 3.13.495a5.73 5.73 0 0 0 2.547-.567 1 1 0 0 0 .563-.9V5.466a.998.998 0 0 0-1.437-.9c-1.345.654-2.731.317-4.331-.071-1.729-.42-3.687-.895-5.678.072A1 1 0 0 0 6 5.466v6.769zm3.111-1.48c1.094 0 2.148.256 3.129.495 1.381.335 2.6.63 3.768.289V6.836c-1.488.27-2.93-.08-4.24-.398-1.379-.335-2.598-.632-3.768-.29v4.704a6.195 6.195 0 0 1 1.111-.097z" fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></span> Share question feedback</span></span></button></div><hr></div><div class="question-div-paper"><div class="passage-details"><div class="passage-header"><b> Passage :</b></div><div class="passage-header">Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions given below it.<br><br>Japan has long been a significant investor in India's infrastructure sector.

Of late, there have been consistent efforts by both New Delhi and Tokyo to transform this economic momentum into a "special strategic and global partnership". Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's three-day visit to India this month, during which both sides agreed to major deals, including the introduction of Japan's bullet train technology in India and an agreement on nuclear partnership, clearly sets the stage for elevated bilateral ties in the future. The potential of Indo-Japanese economic partnership is huge. Despite India being one the world's largest economies, it accounts for only about 1 per cent of Japan's imports, exports and direct investments abroad. The proposed bullet train link between Mumbai and Ahmedabad, which will have access to a soft Japanese loan of $12-15 billion at a concessional interest rate of 0.1 per cent, will cement economic cooperation further. Besides, this suits well the Prime Minister's agenda of building quality infrastructure in the country. The civil nuclear cooperation deal, after five years of talks, marks a complete reversal of the policy Japan adopted towards India after the Pokhran nuclear tests in May 1998. Tokyo, which considers itself a champion of non-proliferation, had suspended much of its aid after India's nuclear test. The deal, however, can be seen as a Japanese seal of approval to India's status as a nuclear-armed state. <br><br>To be sure, enhanced economic and energy cooperation will benefit both countries. Japan has capital and skill whereas India has huge untapped potential. What they need is a clear road map, which, as the recent official exchanges show, is in the works. But at the same time, India should be wary of the great game going on in Asia. It may not be a coincidence that Japan is shedding its historical pacifist foreign policy, which helped its rise as an economic giant in Asia, at a time when its tensions with China are on the rise and the United States has been "pivoting" towards Asia. The American strategy appears to be to build an alliance in Asia to contain the rise of China. Japan, Washington's strongest ally in Asia, is obviously one of the pillars of this "pivot" strategy. It is hardly a secret that both the American and Japanese establishments want India to "swing" towards their alliance. Mr. Abe had earlier written about the strategic need to forge a "democratic security diamond" with the U.S., Australia and India. This is the challenge India's policymakers would face while deepening the country's partnership with Japan further. New Delhi should get its economic and strategic priorities right and state them clearly. To script its own rise, India should build strong ties with each power, instead of aligning with any particular bloc. The country will gain more from everybody's rise rather than joining some geopolitical alliance that is not in its primary interest.<br></div></div><div id="Language_Skills" class="question-details-Language-skill"><b>Type:&nbsp;</b> MCQ Single &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Marks:&nbsp;</b>  +3/-0 &nbsp;&nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Topic:&nbsp;</b> Verbal &gt; Reading Comprehension  &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Time Spent:&nbsp;</b><div>0 Mins 0 Secs</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-paper-number">8.&nbsp; </div> <div class="question-paper-question-text">According to the author, what will enhance the economic cooperation between India and Japan further?</div></div><div class="question-paper-options"><div class="question-paper-option">A.&nbsp;The civil nuclear cooperation deal</div><div class="question-paper-option">B.&nbsp;Enhanced cooperation between the two countries in the field of petroleum</div><div class="question-paper-option">C.&nbsp;Defence ties between India and Japan</div><div class="question-paper-option">D.&nbsp;The proposed bullet train link between Mumbai and Ahmedabad</div><div class="question-paper-option">E.&nbsp;Both 1 and 2</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-status-solution">Status : &nbsp;<div class="unanswered-answer">Unanswered</div></div></div><div class="question-paper-text-actual-solution"><b>Answer :  D</b></div><div class="solution"><div data-accordion-component="Accordion" class="accordion"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItem" class="accordion__item"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemHeading" role="heading" class="accordion__heading" aria-level="3"><div id="accordion__heading-7" aria-disabled="false" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accordion__panel-7" role="button" tabindex="0" class="accordion__button" data-accordion-component="AccordionItemButton"></div></div><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemPanel" class="accordion__panel" role="region" aria-labelledby="accordion__heading-7" id="accordion__panel-7" >Refer to the first paragraph where the author mentions about the proposed bullet train link between Mumbai and Ahmedabad.</div></div></div></div><div class="bookmark-question"><button class="bookmark-button Button__StyledButton-sc-1o41kgk-0 hHWAHx" spacing="default" type="button"><span style="align-self: center; display: inline-flex; flex-wrap: nowrap; max-width: 100%; position: relative;"><span style="align-items: center; align-self: center; flex: 1 1 auto; margin: 0px 4px; max-width: 100%; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; transition: opacity 0.3s ease 0s; opacity: 1;"><span class="sc-iQKALj jOPeQg"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation"><path d="M12 16.373l3.98 2.193-.76-4.655 3.276-3.347-4.524-.69L12 5.687l-1.972 4.189-4.524.689L8.78 13.91l-.762 4.655L12 16.373zm0 2.283l-3.016 1.662a2 2 0 0 1-2.939-2.075l.599-3.656-2.57-2.624a2 2 0 0 1 1.129-3.377l3.47-.528 1.518-3.224a2 2 0 0 1 3.618 0l1.519 3.224 3.47.528a2 2 0 0 1 1.127 3.377l-2.569 2.624.599 3.656a2 2 0 0 1-2.94 2.075L12 18.656z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></span>Bookmark</span></span></button><button class="bookmark-button Button__StyledButton-sc-1o41kgk-0 hHWAHx" spacing="default" type="button"><span style="align-self: center; display: inline-flex; flex-wrap: nowrap; max-width: 100%; position: relative;"><span style="align-items: center; align-self: center; flex: 1 1 auto; margin: 0px 4px; max-width: 100%; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; transition: opacity 0.3s ease 0s; opacity: 1;"><span class="sc-iQKALj jOPeQg"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation"><path d="M6 12.235v6.446c0 .537.45.977 1 .977s1-.44 1-.977v-5.778c1.17-.341 2.389-.045 3.768.29.982.238 2.036.495 3.13.495a5.73 5.73 0 0 0 2.547-.567 1 1 0 0 0 .563-.9V5.466a.998.998 0 0 0-1.437-.9c-1.345.654-2.731.317-4.331-.071-1.729-.42-3.687-.895-5.678.072A1 1 0 0 0 6 5.466v6.769zm3.111-1.48c1.094 0 2.148.256 3.129.495 1.381.335 2.6.63 3.768.289V6.836c-1.488.27-2.93-.08-4.24-.398-1.379-.335-2.598-.632-3.768-.29v4.704a6.195 6.195 0 0 1 1.111-.097z" fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></span> Share question feedback</span></span></button></div><hr></div><div class="question-div-paper"><div class="passage-details"><div class="passage-header"><b> Passage :</b></div><div class="passage-header"> In this section, each passage consists of six sentences.
