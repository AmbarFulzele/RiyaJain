Nevertheless, empirical research on FDI is still concentrated on manufacturing. As the basic characteristics of services and goods differ - the main specifics of services are intangibility, inseparability of production and consumption, heterogeneity, perishability and restricted ownership one would expect that the determinants of internationalisation are not the same in the two sectors. This may hold true although the separation line between goods and services has become quite blurred reflecting the growing service content of manufacturing and a certain tendency towards the industrialisation of parts of the service sector. Against this background, it is surprising that firm-level econometric research dealing with the inter nationalisation of service firms by way of FDI is scarce. Particularly, only few studies cover the whole service sector, and there is hardly any empirical work investigating systematically the differences between manufacturing and services.<br><br>The analysis of the internationalisation of services companies is dominated until now by studies for specific industries. To mention are, in particular, financial services, ICT/software, the hotel industry, business services and retail trade. The majority of contributions are case studies or small-sample descriptive analyses focusing on one or very few service industries. Econometric studies dealing at firm level with specific service industries became available, with some exceptions, only in recent years. The concentration on industry-specific studies may be due to the absence of (large scale) datasets covering the whole service sector as is already pointed out in some earlier review articles. Another reason may be the presumption that the service sector is particularly heterogeneous as advocated, for example, by Dunning who argues that type and combination are integral to the service sector. <br><br><br>The present study contributes to filling this research gap by identifying and comparing for the two sectors (a) the drivers of the internationalisation of firm activity in terms of exports and FDI, and (b) the determinants of the choice among specific forms of FDI in terms of business functions. As mentioned, there is little evidence from econometric studies with respect to the first topic, and the second one, to the best of our knowledge, has never been investigated at all. In order to analyse these problems we formulate two empirical models using the well-known OLI paradigm as theoretical framework. <br><br>The present analysis is an extension of Hollenstein, who estimated, using data for 1998, OLI-based models that are structurally similar to model I and II but did so only for the entire business sector. The present research also goes beyond who disaggregated the business sector in manufacturing and services and estimated a model comparable to our model I which distinguishes between "exporting only" and "direct foreign presence". However, this author did not further differentiate within the category of firms with FDI as we do in model II. The paper is based on a large dataset containing information from 1921 companies of the Swiss business sector that responded to a comprehensive survey we conducted in 2010 among a random sample drawn from the official enterprise census of 2008. The available data allow a rich specification of the explanatory part of the two models. By estimating model I and II we are able to significantly add to previous evidence on the differences between manufacturing and service companies with respect to the determinants of international activities - a topic strongly neglected in empirical research. In line with our hypotheses, we find, for both sectors, that an OLI-based model is well suited not only for explaining the propensity of firms to go international by means of exports and/or FDI (model I) but also differences between specific forms of FDI in terms of business functions (model II). In all models, the explanatory power of the OLI approach is stronger for manufacturing than for services. The results for manufacturing are in line with the stages view of internationalization, what is only partly the case for the services sector. <br><br>As early as in the 1970s, Dunning argued that no single approach is able to explain a firm's international activities. He proposed an eclectic theory of international production, the well-known OLI paradigm, which he further developed over the years to account for changing features of the international economy and new theoretical approaches. In the most recent version the OLI model applies not only to international production but also to other business functions. In addition, it emphasizes the strategic aspects of internationalization more explicitly by drawing on the "resource-based" or "dynamic capability" view of the firm, or the concept of the "knowledge-based company".<br></div></div><div id="Language_Skills" class="question-details-Language-skill" style="/* display: none; */"><b>Type:&nbsp;</b> MCQ Single &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Marks:&nbsp;</b>  +3/-0 &nbsp;&nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Topic:&nbsp;</b> Verbal &gt; Reading Comprehension  &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Time Spent:&nbsp;</b><div>0 Mins 33 Secs</div></div><div class="question-paper-text" style="

Nevertheless, empirical research on FDI is still concentrated on manufacturing. As the basic characteristics of services and goods differ - the main specifics of services are intangibility, inseparability of production and consumption, heterogeneity, perishability and restricted ownership one would expect that the determinants of internationalisation are not the same in the two sectors. This may hold true although the separation line between goods and services has become quite blurred reflecting the growing service content of manufacturing and a certain tendency towards the industrialisation of parts of the service sector. Against this background, it is surprising that firm-level econometric research dealing with the inter nationalisation of service firms by way of FDI is scarce. Particularly, only few studies cover the whole service sector, and there is hardly any empirical work investigating systematically the differences between manufacturing and services.<br><br>The analysis of the internationalisation of services companies is dominated until now by studies for specific industries. To mention are, in particular, financial services, ICT/software, the hotel industry, business services and retail trade. The majority of contributions are case studies or small-sample descriptive analyses focusing on one or very few service industries. Econometric studies dealing at firm level with specific service industries became available, with some exceptions, only in recent years. The concentration on industry-specific studies may be due to the absence of (large scale) datasets covering the whole service sector as is already pointed out in some earlier review articles. Another reason may be the presumption that the service sector is particularly heterogeneous as advocated, for example, by Dunning who argues that type and combination are integral to the service sector. <br><br><br>The present study contributes to filling this research gap by identifying and comparing for the two sectors (a) the drivers of the internationalisation of firm activity in terms of exports and FDI, and (b) the determinants of the choice among specific forms of FDI in terms of business functions. As mentioned, there is little evidence from econometric studies with respect to the first topic, and the second one, to the best of our knowledge, has never been investigated at all. In order to analyse these problems we formulate two empirical models using the well-known OLI paradigm as theoretical framework. <br><br>The present analysis is an extension of Hollenstein, who estimated, using data for 1998, OLI-based models that are structurally similar to model I and II but did so only for the entire business sector. The present research also goes beyond who disaggregated the business sector in manufacturing and services and estimated a model comparable to our model I which distinguishes between "exporting only" and "direct foreign presence". However, this author did not further differentiate within the category of firms with FDI as we do in model II. The paper is based on a large dataset containing information from 1921 companies of the Swiss business sector that responded to a comprehensive survey we conducted in 2010 among a random sample drawn from the official enterprise census of 2008. The available data allow a rich specification of the explanatory part of the two models. By estimating model I and II we are able to significantly add to previous evidence on the differences between manufacturing and service companies with respect to the determinants of international activities - a topic strongly neglected in empirical research. In line with our hypotheses, we find, for both sectors, that an OLI-based model is well suited not only for explaining the propensity of firms to go international by means of exports and/or FDI (model I) but also differences between specific forms of FDI in terms of business functions (model II). In all models, the explanatory power of the OLI approach is stronger for manufacturing than for services. The results for manufacturing are in line with the stages view of internationalization, what is only partly the case for the services sector. <br><br>As early as in the 1970s, Dunning argued that no single approach is able to explain a firm's international activities. He proposed an eclectic theory of international production, the well-known OLI paradigm, which he further developed over the years to account for changing features of the international economy and new theoretical approaches. In the most recent version the OLI model applies not only to international production but also to other business functions. In addition, it emphasizes the strategic aspects of internationalization more explicitly by drawing on the "resource-based" or "dynamic capability" view of the firm, or the concept of the "knowledge-based company".<br></div></div><div id="Language_Skills" class="question-details-Language-skill"><b>Type:&nbsp;</b> MCQ Single &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Marks:&nbsp;</b>  +3/-0 &nbsp;&nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Topic:&nbsp;</b> Verbal &gt; Reading Comprehension  &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Time Spent:&nbsp;</b><div>0 Mins 3 Secs</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-paper-number">4.&nbsp; </div> <div class="question-paper-question-text">What is the tone of the author in the passage?</div></div><div class="question-paper-options"><div class="question-paper-option">A.&nbsp;Diffusive</div><div class="question-paper-option">B.&nbsp;Detailed</div><div class="question-paper-option">C.&nbsp;Meandering</div><div class="question-paper-option">D.&nbsp;Wandering</div><div class="question-paper-option">E.&nbsp;Discursive</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-status-solution">Status : &nbsp;<div class="incorrect-answer">Incorrect</div> <span class="sc-iQKALj bCJYOg"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation"><path d="M12 10.586L6.707 5.293a1 1 0 0 0-1.414 1.414L10.586 12l-5.293 5.293a1 1 0 0 0 1.414 1.414L12 13.414l5.293 5.293a1 1 0 0 0 1.414-1.414L13.414 12l5.293-5.293a1 1 0 1 0-1.414-1.414L12 10.586z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></span> </div></div><div class="question-paper-text-actual-solution"></div><div class="question-paper-text-actual-solution"><b>Answer :  B</b></div><div class="solution"><div data-accordion-component="Accordion" class="accordion"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItem" class="accordion__item"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemHeading" role="heading" class="accordion__heading" aria-level="3"><div id="accordion__heading-243" aria-disabled="false" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accordion__panel-243" role="button" tabindex="0" class="accordion__button" data-accordion-component="AccordionItemButton"></div></div><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemPanel" class="accordion__panel" role="region" aria-labelledby="accordion__heading-243" id="accordion__panel-243" >The author of the passage approaches the subject in great detail.

This is India ... the country where faction was invented before the zero. If even the heart is divided into four parts can you expect us Indians to divide ourselves into less than 400?" <br><br>This statement, equal parts plea and diagnosis, only begins to describe the challenge confronting modern-day India. As Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the Indian leader of the Muslim League, said ruefully in a 1940 speech, seven years before he founded Pakistan: "The Hindus and Muslims belong to two different religious philosophies, social customs and literature. They neither intermarry, nor inter-dine together, and indeed they belong to two different civilizations." To say that India is driven by myriad factions and castes and, more fundamentally, divided between two religions is to describe a particularly vicious curse. <br><br>One of the achievements of Ramachandra Guha's deeply felt new history is that the author remains acutely aware of both the truths and falsehoods contained in Jinnah's remark. A visitor to the world's second most populous country can, without much effort, witness nasty and sectarian politicking in New Delhi or Mumbai. And the consequences - vicious religious rioting, scars on both India's landscape and her people - are all too visible. Yet Hindus and Muslims do dine in one another's homes, and they play on the same cricket teams. Guha's central aim is to register these discordant notes, and for the most part he succeeds admirably. <br><br>"India After Gandhi" begins with the British, who after years of resisting Indian self-government on the grounds that the country was both too mature ("much too old to learn that business," Kipling remarked) and too young ("they are still infants," one colonialist said), abruptly quit the subcontinent in 1947. Gandhi was murdered less than six months later by a Hindu extremist, and millions were uprooted during the partition of India and Pakistan, many of them killed in religious violence. The new Indian state faced the dual challenges of integrating its remaining Muslim population and appeasing its Hindu majority.<br><br>Much of what was accomplished in the next 15 years was due to the popularity and will of India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Despite enormous obstacles within his own Congress Party, Nehru set out to ensure more rights for women and the downtrodden. Guha expertly traces Nehru's leadership in the writing of India's Constitution, where legislators overcame potentially fatal disagreements over issues like what language the document would appear in. The finished product, which Guha refers to as a liberal, humanist credo, not only protected numerous basic rights but also provided reservations for "untouchables." <br><br>Some scholars, Sunil Khilnani among them, have argued that by identifying caste as an organizing principle in Indian society, Nehru and his allies inadvertently laid the groundwork for a more <strong>schismatic</strong> political culture, greater discrimination against Muslims and eventually, the success of the Hindu right. Guha, who is perceptive about both the hardships faced by Muslims over the past 60 years and the caste-based conflicts that endure to this day, disappointingly declines to address these charges. Rather, he implies that Nehru did the best he could under the circumstances to prevent further split. His success with the Constitution, as well as his support for bills that raised the status of Hindu women and altered unfair property laws, are just some of the ways in which he had a positive impact on India's young democracy. Guha paints a convincing portrait of Nehru's good political sense (if never really giving us much insight into his personality).</div></div><div id="Language_Skills" class="question-details-Language-skill"><b>Type:&nbsp;</b> MCQ Single &nbsp;&nbsp;

This is India ... the country where faction was invented before the zero. If even the heart is divided into four parts can you expect us Indians to divide ourselves into less than 400?" <br><br>This statement, equal parts plea and diagnosis, only begins to describe the challenge confronting modern-day India. As Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the Indian leader of the Muslim League, said ruefully in a 1940 speech, seven years before he founded Pakistan: "The Hindus and Muslims belong to two different religious philosophies, social customs and literature. They neither intermarry, nor inter-dine together, and indeed they belong to two different civilizations." To say that India is driven by myriad factions and castes and, more fundamentally, divided between two religions is to describe a particularly vicious curse. <br><br>One of the achievements of Ramachandra Guha's deeply felt new history is that the author remains acutely aware of both the truths and falsehoods contained in Jinnah's remark. A visitor to the world's second most populous country can, without much effort, witness nasty and sectarian politicking in New Delhi or Mumbai. And the consequences - vicious religious rioting, scars on both India's landscape and her people - are all too visible. Yet Hindus and Muslims do dine in one another's homes, and they play on the same cricket teams. Guha's central aim is to register these discordant notes, and for the most part he succeeds admirably. <br><br>"India After Gandhi" begins with the British, who after years of resisting Indian self-government on the grounds that the country was both too mature ("much too old to learn that business," Kipling remarked) and too young ("they are still infants," one colonialist said), abruptly quit the subcontinent in 1947. Gandhi was murdered less than six months later by a Hindu extremist, and millions were uprooted during the partition of India and Pakistan, many of them killed in religious violence. The new Indian state faced the dual challenges of integrating its remaining Muslim population and appeasing its Hindu majority.<br><br>Much of what was accomplished in the next 15 years was due to the popularity and will of India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Despite enormous obstacles within his own Congress Party, Nehru set out to ensure more rights for women and the downtrodden. Guha expertly traces Nehru's leadership in the writing of India's Constitution, where legislators overcame potentially fatal disagreements over issues like what language the document would appear in. The finished product, which Guha refers to as a liberal, humanist credo, not only protected numerous basic rights but also provided reservations for "untouchables." <br><br>Some scholars, Sunil Khilnani among them, have argued that by identifying caste as an organizing principle in Indian society, Nehru and his allies inadvertently laid the groundwork for a more <strong>schismatic</strong> political culture, greater discrimination against Muslims and eventually, the success of the Hindu right. Guha, who is perceptive about both the hardships faced by Muslims over the past 60 years and the caste-based conflicts that endure to this day, disappointingly declines to address these charges. Rather, he implies that Nehru did the best he could under the circumstances to prevent further split. His success with the Constitution, as well as his support for bills that raised the status of Hindu women and altered unfair property laws, are just some of the ways in which he had a positive impact on India's young democracy. Guha paints a convincing portrait of Nehru's good political sense (if never really giving us much insight into his personality).</div></div><div id="Language_Skills" class="question-details-Language-skill"><b>Type:&nbsp;</b> MCQ Single &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Marks:&nbsp;</b>  +3/-0 &nbsp;&nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Topic:&nbsp;</b> Verbal &gt; Reading Comprehension  &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Time Spent:&nbsp;</b><div>0 Mins 3 Secs</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-paper-number">9.&nbsp; </div> <div class="question-paper-question-text">Which of the following can be a suitable title of the passage?</div></div><div class="question-paper-options"><div class="question-paper-option">A.&nbsp;Nehru and Jinnah</div><div class="question-paper-option">B.&nbsp;Hindus and Muslims</div><div class="question-paper-option">C.&nbsp;Ramchandra Guha and his book</div><div class="question-paper-option">D.&nbsp; Indian independence struggle</div><div class="question-paper-option">E.&nbsp; Jinnah's patriotism</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-status-solution">Status : &nbsp;<div class="incorrect-answer">Incorrect</div> <span class="sc-iQKALj bCJYOg"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation"><path d="M12 10.586L6.707 5.293a1 1 0 0 0-1.414 1.414L10.586 12l-5.293 5.293a1 1 0 0 0 1.414 1.414L12 13.414l5.293 5.293a1 1 0 0 0 1.414-1.414L13.414 12l5.293-5.293a1 1 0 1 0-1.414-1.414L12 10.586z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></span> </div></div><div class="question-paper-text-actual-solution"></div><div class="question-paper-text-actual-solution"><b>Answer :  C</b></div><div class="solution"><div data-accordion-component="Accordion" class="accordion"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItem" class="accordion__item"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemHeading" role="heading" class="accordion__heading" aria-level="3"><div id="accordion__heading-248" aria-disabled="false" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accordion__panel-248" role="button" tabindex="0" class="accordion__button" data-accordion-component="AccordionItemButton"></div></div><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemPanel" class="accordion__panel" role="region" aria-labelledby="accordion__heading-248" id="accordion__panel-248" >Only option (3) covers the entire passage.

Neither does it provide any information about the other problems suffered by the sector 40 residents and whether the water shortage was restricted to Sector 40.
