The questions are to be answered on the basis of what is stated or implied in the passage.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The use of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) has proliferated over the last three decades. The total number of newly ratified BITs by middle income countries multiplied more than 55 times, from 33 in 1985 to 1,854 in 2012.<br>
<br>
BITs reduce political risk to foreign investors. They establish clear, simple and enforceable rules for foreign investment protection from expropriation, specify the circumstances under which expropriation takes place and the compensation standards, and design the necessary investment dispute settlement mechanisms between states and investors. BITs therefore reduce policy uncertainty and guarantee the presence and adoption of rules for foreign investment protection, which may boost foreign investor's confidence and promote foreign investment flows.<br>
<br>
The domain of foreign investment BITs extends beyond FDI. FDI has been the only type of capital flows examined in the BITs literature. Foreign investment, in the 2012 U.S. Model Bilateral Investment Treaties for example, is defined as “every asset that an investor owns or controls, directly or indirectly, that has the characteristics of an investment, including such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk”. An investment may take the form of an enterprise; shares, stock, and other forms of equity participation in an enterprise; bonds, debentures, other debt instruments, and loans; and futures, options, and other derivatives. Therefore, BITs provide political risk guarantees to portfolio equity, private non-guaranteed debt in addition to FDI. They may even provide guarantees to public and publicly guaranteed debt as far as multinational corporations seek guarantees on their loans from host country governments.<br>
<br>
Public debt, as well as FDI, is particularly an important capital flow in low income countries. Hindered by low per capita income, financial underdevelopment and low credit ratings, governments and financial institutions of low income countries tend to rely more heavily on public debt to finance their investment and possibly consumption needs.<br>
<br>
The capital flows determinants literature has developed over time. The development largely reflects the increasing financial globalization that has taken place over the past three decades and the role of external and domestic factors in mobilizing capital flows to recipient countries. Among the domestic factors, institutions and political risk has attracted special attention in the capital flows literature. Increasing corruption and weak rule of law were among the institutions that increased political risk and triggered the 1997 Asian financial crisis. In addition, the role of capital controls and financial development in attracting capital flows has been explored in the literature. In the FDI literature specifically the influence of BITs, as an investor protection mechanism, on FDI has also been examined.<br>
<br>
The determinants of capital flows have been extensively examined in the capital flows literature. Some studies have distinguished between the role of external (push) and domestic (pull) factors explain capital flows during the 1990s in terms of external factors to the recipient economy and domestic factors. External factors to the recipient economy include declining world interest rates, which improve creditworthiness and reduce default risk in developing countries, global business cycle, integration of world capital markets, diversification of investments internationally and contagion effects.<br>
<br>
Domestic factors include sound domestic monetary and fiscal policies, and trade and capital market liberalization.<br>
<br>
Over the past three decades of increased global financial integration many governments adopted policies of financial liberalization in order to lure more capital flows and reap the benefits of smoothing consumption, boosting investment, and speeding up economic growth, while other governments adopted capital control measures to reduce the disruption that the high volumes and volatility of capital inflows and outflows create. A number of studies have focused on the impact of financial liberalization and capital controls examine the efficacy of capital controls in 74 countries during the period 1995–2005 in stemming inflows and outflows of equity, FDI, and debt holdings. They find that the efficacy of capital controls is on the outflow side but is very little or absent on the inflow side. In addition they find that the efficacy of capital controls is low in low and middle income countries. Okada attributes the efficacy of capital controls to institutional quality, and examines the effect of these two factors and their interaction on FDI and foreign private investment. He finds that while there is no individual impact of financial openness and institutional quality on capital inflows, the interaction between these two factors has a significant impact.<br>
<br>
Recent studies have focused on the role of institutions and political risk as domestic factors in attracting capital flows explores the drivers of global portfolio investment flows using high frequency mutual funds data for the period 2005–2010 differentiating between financial crises and the subsequent recovery, and between common global shocks and country-specific factors. He finds that during crises there is a strong divergence in capital flows across countries with dynamics of capital flows primarily driven by safe-haven flows. He also finds that the effect of global shocks, in particular during the recovery period, was heterogeneous and depended on the recipient country's institutional quality, country risk, and the strength of macroeconomic fundamentals and policies. He contends that, “countries are far from innocent bystanders that are powerless in being exposed to volatile global markets, and that indeed they have tools to insulate to some extent their economies from adverse global shocks”.<br>
<br>
Opacity of the operating environment seems to matter for capital flows. Hooper and Kim examine the role of operating environment opacity in influencing FDI, portfolio investment, and international bank lending. They argue that opacity in general discourages capital flows. However, with the profit opportunities it creates, opacity may increase capital flows. For example, multinational corporations (MNCs) may concentrate on FDI to exploit accounting and reporting opacity in order to maximize profit. Other forms of capital flows may respond differently to accounting opacity.<br>
<br>
Interestingly they point out that opacity in corruption might increase FDI or international bank lending. Corruption opacity can increase MNCs likelihood of obtaining loans, which are government guaranteed, or favorable tax treatments, thus increasing FDI flows to the country. Corruption opacity might take the form of government guarantees of crony capitalists' international loans, increasing the likelihood of obtaining loans and thus international bank lending. In contrast, legal opacity reduces contract enforcement and protection of property rights and thus capital flows in general.<br>
<br>
In explaining the Lucas paradox on why capital flows from poor to rich countries, contrary to the neoclassical model prediction of capital flowing in the opposite direction, Papaioannou (2009) focuses on the role of institutions in explaining these flows and finds that weak institutions – weak property rights protection, inefficient legal system and high risk of investment expropriation deter banking flows. Similarly, in examining mainly the role of demographic structure in international portfolio flows, De Santis and Luhrmann (2009) find that lower quality institutions deter net portfolio inflows explaining the capital reallocation from developing to developed countries.</p>

He contends that, “countries are far from innocent bystanders that are powerless in being exposed to volatile global markets, and that indeed they have tools to insulate to some extent their economies from adverse global shocks”.<br>
<br>
Opacity of the operating environment seems to matter for capital flows. Hooper and Kim examine the role of operating environment opacity in influencing FDI, portfolio investment, and international bank lending. They argue that opacity in general discourages capital flows. However, with the profit opportunities it creates, opacity may increase capital flows. For example, multinational corporations (MNCs) may concentrate on FDI to exploit accounting and reporting opacity in order to maximize profit. Other forms of capital flows may respond differently to accounting opacity.<br>
<br>
Interestingly they point out that opacity in corruption might increase FDI or international bank lending. Corruption opacity can increase MNCs likelihood of obtaining loans, which are government guaranteed, or favorable tax treatments, thus increasing FDI flows to the country. Corruption opacity might take the form of government guarantees of crony capitalists' international loans, increasing the likelihood of obtaining loans and thus international bank lending. In contrast, legal opacity reduces contract enforcement and protection of property rights and thus capital flows in general.<br>
<br>
In explaining the Lucas paradox on why capital flows from poor to rich countries, contrary to the neoclassical model prediction of capital flowing in the opposite direction, Papaioannou (2009) focuses on the role of institutions in explaining these flows and finds that weak institutions – weak property rights protection, inefficient legal system and high risk of investment expropriation deter banking flows. Similarly, in examining mainly the role of demographic structure in international portfolio flows, De Santis and Luhrmann (2009) find that lower quality institutions deter net portfolio inflows explaining the capital reallocation from developing to developed countries.</p>

The questions are to be answered on the basis of what is stated or implied in the passage.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The use of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) has proliferated over the last three decades. The total number of newly ratified BITs by middle income countries multiplied more than 55 times, from 33 in 1985 to 1,854 in 2012.<br>
<br>
BITs reduce political risk to foreign investors. They establish clear, simple and enforceable rules for foreign investment protection from expropriation, specify the circumstances under which expropriation takes place and the compensation standards, and design the necessary investment dispute settlement mechanisms between states and investors. BITs therefore reduce policy uncertainty and guarantee the presence and adoption of rules for foreign investment protection, which may boost foreign investor's confidence and promote foreign investment flows.<br>
<br>
The domain of foreign investment BITs extends beyond FDI. FDI has been the only type of capital flows examined in the BITs literature. Foreign investment, in the 2012 U.S. Model Bilateral Investment Treaties for example, is defined as “every asset that an investor owns or controls, directly or indirectly, that has the characteristics of an investment, including such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk”. An investment may take the form of an enterprise; shares, stock, and other forms of equity participation in an enterprise; bonds, debentures, other debt instruments, and loans; and futures, options, and other derivatives. Therefore, BITs provide political risk guarantees to portfolio equity, private non-guaranteed debt in addition to FDI. They may even provide guarantees to public and publicly guaranteed debt as far as multinational corporations seek guarantees on their loans from host country governments.<br>
<br>
Public debt, as well as FDI, is particularly an important capital flow in low income countries. Hindered by low per capita income, financial underdevelopment and low credit ratings, governments and financial institutions of low income countries tend to rely more heavily on public debt to finance their investment and possibly consumption needs.<br>
<br>
The capital flows determinants literature has developed over time. The development largely reflects the increasing financial globalization that has taken place over the past three decades and the role of external and domestic factors in mobilizing capital flows to recipient countries. Among the domestic factors, institutions and political risk has attracted special attention in the capital flows literature. Increasing corruption and weak rule of law were among the institutions that increased political risk and triggered the 1997 Asian financial crisis. In addition, the role of capital controls and financial development in attracting capital flows has been explored in the literature. In the FDI literature specifically the influence of BITs, as an investor protection mechanism, on FDI has also been examined.<br>
<br>
The determinants of capital flows have been extensively examined in the capital flows literature. Some studies have distinguished between the role of external (push) and domestic (pull) factors explain capital flows during the 1990s in terms of external factors to the recipient economy and domestic factors. External factors to the recipient economy include declining world interest rates, which improve creditworthiness and reduce default risk in developing countries, global business cycle, integration of world capital markets, diversification of investments internationally and contagion effects.<br>
<br>
Domestic factors include sound domestic monetary and fiscal policies, and trade and capital market liberalization.<br>
<br>
Over the past three decades of increased global financial integration many governments adopted policies of financial liberalization in order to lure more capital flows and reap the benefits of smoothing consumption, boosting investment, and speeding up economic growth, while other governments adopted capital control measures to reduce the disruption that the high volumes and volatility of capital inflows and outflows create. A number of studies have focused on the impact of financial liberalization and capital controls examine the efficacy of capital controls in 74 countries during the period 1995–2005 in stemming inflows and outflows of equity, FDI, and debt holdings. They find that the efficacy of capital controls is on the outflow side but is very little or absent on the inflow side. In addition they find that the efficacy of capital controls is low in low and middle income countries. Okada attributes the efficacy of capital controls to institutional quality, and examines the effect of these two factors and their interaction on FDI and foreign private investment. He finds that while there is no individual impact of financial openness and institutional quality on capital inflows, the interaction between these two factors has a significant impact.<br>
<br>
Recent studies have focused on the role of institutions and political risk as domestic factors in attracting capital flows explores the drivers of global portfolio investment flows using high frequency mutual funds data for the period 2005–2010 differentiating between financial crises and the subsequent recovery, and between common global shocks and country-specific factors. He finds that during crises there is a strong divergence in capital flows across countries with dynamics of capital flows primarily driven by safe-haven flows. He also finds that the effect of global shocks, in particular during the recovery period, was heterogeneous and depended on the recipient country's institutional quality, country risk, and the strength of macroeconomic fundamentals and policies. He contends that, “countries are far from innocent bystanders that are powerless in being exposed to volatile global markets, and that indeed they have tools to insulate to some extent their economies from adverse global shocks”.<br>
<br>
Opacity of the operating environment seems to matter for capital flows. Hooper and Kim examine the role of operating environment opacity in influencing FDI, portfolio investment, and international bank lending. They argue that opacity in general discourages capital flows. However, with the profit opportunities it creates, opacity may increase capital flows. For example, multinational corporations (MNCs) may concentrate on FDI to exploit accounting and reporting opacity in order to maximize profit.

In contrast, legal opacity reduces contract enforcement and protection of property rights and thus capital flows in general.<br>

His remarks may appear out of sync with the official discourse on India's recent economic performance, especially the liberalisation of foreign direct investment and record inflows clocked since the present government was sworn in. Mr. Lee's concerns, however, don't stem from FDI policy per se, but two intertwined reform showpieces of the JDA - one abandoned after hot pursuit in its first year and another that remains a work in progress. These are amendments to the land acquisition law and improvements in the ease of doing business, respectively. Indian officials told business leaders accompanying the Singapore Prime Minister that they are free to invest in India if they can, on their own, acquire the land to set up shop on. As Mr. Lee pointed out, that makes investing in India virtually impossible - industrial parks that Singapore had proposed in the past remain non-starters. The Centre may not be used to such public plain-speaking, even from Western leaders with longer reform wish lists, but it must take the Prime Minister's cue for introspection and course correction. <br><br>Modernising India's land laws was high on the government's agenda in 2014-15; an ordinance was promulgated thrice to effect necessary changes till Parliament could pass a law. Global investors were assured that land acquired under the ordinance would be safe from any subsequent changes to the law. But the Centre wilted in the face of Opposition resistance. A model land-leasing law formulated by the Niti Aayog was mooted for States to adopt instead, but a billion-dollar plant is unlikely to come up on leased foundations. Since then, a proposed nuclear plant has moved out from Gujarat owing to land acquisition problems, India's largest FDI proposal from South Korea's Posco is all but off, and job creation has hit a five-year low. India moved up 12 places in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business index last year and may rise further. But the index is only based on speed of paperwork in Mumbai and Delhi, where there is little space for big new industries; such rankings don't directly translate into more FDI. The Prime Minister has set a target for India to reach the top 50 ranks in the index, but getting a construction permit online is no good if large tracts of land cannot provide job-creating investment. If the idea to bury the land reform was to secure farmers' votes and, in the process, alternative jobs are not created for the young and those who want to move out of agriculture, castles in the air are all that will be built.</div></div><div id="Language_Skills" class="question-details-Language-skill"><b>Type:&nbsp;</b> MCQ Single &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Marks:&nbsp;</b>  +1/-0.25 &nbsp;&nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Topic:&nbsp;</b> Verbal &gt; Reading Comprehension  &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Time Spent:&nbsp;</b><div>0 Mins 0 Secs</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-paper-number">5.&nbsp; </div> <div class="question-paper-question-text">What was the Singapore Prime Minister's comment when he visited India?</div></div><div class="question-paper-options"><div class="question-paper-option">A.&nbsp;The government should give license to everyone.</div><div class="question-paper-option">B.&nbsp;Indian banks must give soft loans to the investors.</div><div class="question-paper-option">C.&nbsp;Foreign investors must invest in certain categories of industries only.</div><div class="question-paper-option">D.&nbsp;India must remove obstacles so that foreign investors can operate in the country.</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-status-solution">Status : &nbsp;<div class="unanswered-answer">Unanswered</div></div></div><div class="question-paper-text-actual-solution"><b>Answer :  D</b></div><div class="solution"><div data-accordion-component="Accordion" class="accordion"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItem" class="accordion__item"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemHeading" role="heading" class="accordion__heading" aria-level="3"><div id="accordion__heading-4" aria-disabled="false" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accordion__panel-4" role="button" tabindex="0" class="accordion__button" data-accordion-component="AccordionItemButton">View Solution</div></div><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemPanel" class="accordion__panel" role="region" aria-labelledby="accordion__heading-4" id="accordion__panel-4" hidden="">Refer to the first sentence of the passage for the answer.</div></div></div></div><div class="bookmark-question"><button class="bookmark-button Button__StyledButton-sc-1o41kgk-0 hHWAHx" spacing="default" type="button"><span style="align-self: center; display: inline-flex; flex-wrap: nowrap; max-width: 100%; position: relative;"><span style="align-items: center; align-self: center; flex: 1 1 auto; margin: 0px 4px; max-width: 100%; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; transition: opacity 0.3s ease 0s; opacity: 1;"><span class="sc-iQKALj jOPeQg"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation"><path d="M12 16.373l3.98 2.193-.76-4.655 3.276-3.347-4.524-.69L12 5.687l-1.972 4.189-4.524.689L8.78 13.91l-.762 4.655L12 16.373zm0 2.283l-3.016 1.662a2 2 0 0 1-2.939-2.075l.599-3.656-2.57-2.624a2 2 0 0 1 1.129-3.377l3.47-.528 1.518-3.224a2 2 0 0 1 3.618 0l1.519 3.224 3.47.528a2 2 0 0 1 1.127 3.377l-2.569 2.624.599 3.656a2 2 0 0 1-2.94 2.075L12 18.656z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></span>Bookmark</span></span></button><button class="bookmark-button Button__StyledButton-sc-1o41kgk-0 hHWAHx" spacing="default" type="button"><span style="align-self: center; display: inline-flex; flex-wrap: nowrap; max-width: 100%; position: relative;"><span style="align-items: center; align-self: center; flex: 1 1 auto; margin: 0px 4px; max-width: 100%; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; transition: opacity 0.3s ease 0s; opacity: 1;"><span class="sc-iQKALj jOPeQg"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation"><path d="M6 12.235v6.446c0 .537.45.977 1 .977s1-.44 1-.977v-5.778c1.17-.341 2.389-.045 3.768.29.982.238 2.036.495 3.13.495a5.73 5.73 0 0 0 2.547-.567 1 1 0 0 0 .563-.9V5.466a.998.998 0 0 0-1.437-.9c-1.345.654-2.731.317-4.331-.071-1.729-.42-3.687-.895-5.678.072A1 1 0 0 0 6 5.466v6.769zm3.111-1.48c1.094 0 2.148.256 3.129.495 1.381.335 2.6.63 3.768.289V6.836c-1.488.27-2.93-.08-4.24-.398-1.379-.335-2.598-.632-3.768-.29v4.704a6.195 6.195 0 0 1 1.111-.097z" fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></span> Share question feedback</span></span></button></div><hr></div><div class="question-div-paper"><div class="passage-details"><div class="passage-header"><b> Passage :</b></div><div class="passage-header">Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions give below it. <br><br>India needs a different approach to grow its economy and must remove bottlenecks so that foreign investors can operate in the country just as its own corporates expand their global footprint, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said during his India visit last week.

These are amendments to the land acquisition law and improvements in the ease of doing business, respectively. Indian officials told business leaders accompanying the Singapore Prime Minister that they are free to invest in India if they can, on their own, acquire the land to set up shop on. As Mr. Lee pointed out, that makes investing in India virtually impossible - industrial parks that Singapore had proposed in the past remain non-starters. The Centre may not be used to such public plain-speaking, even from Western leaders with longer reform wish lists, but it must take the Prime Minister's cue for introspection and course correction. <br><br>Modernising India's land laws was high on the government's agenda in 2014-15; an ordinance was promulgated thrice to effect necessary changes till Parliament could pass a law. Global investors were assured that land acquired under the ordinance would be safe from any subsequent changes to the law. But the Centre wilted in the face of Opposition resistance. A model land-leasing law formulated by the Niti Aayog was mooted for States to adopt instead, but a billion-dollar plant is unlikely to come up on leased foundations. Since then, a proposed nuclear plant has moved out from Gujarat owing to land acquisition problems, India's largest FDI proposal from South Korea's Posco is all but off, and job creation has hit a five-year low. India moved up 12 places in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business index last year and may rise further. But the index is only based on speed of paperwork in Mumbai and Delhi, where there is little space for big new industries; such rankings don't directly translate into more FDI. The Prime Minister has set a target for India to reach the top 50 ranks in the index, but getting a construction permit online is no good if large tracts of land cannot provide job-creating investment. If the idea to bury the land reform was to secure farmers' votes and, in the process, alternative jobs are not created for the young and those who want to move out of agriculture, castles in the air are all that will be built.</div></div><div id="Language_Skills" class="question-details-Language-skill"><b>Type:&nbsp;</b> MCQ Single &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Marks:&nbsp;</b>  +1/-0.25 &nbsp;&nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Topic:&nbsp;</b> Verbal &gt; Reading Comprehension  &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Time Spent:&nbsp;</b><div>0 Mins 0 Secs</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-paper-number">6.&nbsp; </div> <div class="question-paper-question-text">What is the meaning of the idiom 'building castles in the air'?</div></div><div class="question-paper-options"><div class="question-paper-option">A.&nbsp;To get involved in some ambitious construction projects</div><div class="question-paper-option">B.&nbsp;To daydream</div><div class="question-paper-option">C.&nbsp;To set a target</div><div class="question-paper-option">D.&nbsp;To work tremendously hard</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-status-solution">Status : &nbsp;<div class="unanswered-answer">Unanswered</div></div></div><div class="question-paper-text-actual-solution"><b>Answer :  B</b></div><div class="solution"><div data-accordion-component="Accordion" class="accordion"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItem" class="accordion__item"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemHeading" role="heading" class="accordion__heading" aria-level="3"><div id="accordion__heading-5" aria-disabled="false" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accordion__panel-5" role="button" tabindex="0" class="accordion__button" data-accordion-component="AccordionItemButton">View Solution</div></div><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemPanel" class="accordion__panel" role="region" aria-labelledby="accordion__heading-5" id="accordion__panel-5" hidden=""><p>To create dreams, hopes, or plans that are impossible, unrealistic, or have very little chance of succeeding</p>

Choose the best answer to each question.<br>
<br>
Way back in 2000, we had the "technology workforce crisis". The big issue was the cap that the U.S. government had put on H-1B visas and the strong need that companies had for developers and other technologists.<br>
Then along came the dot-com bust, and the news was all about layoffs and identifying the real goats in the Internet debacle. As the economy recovered from the bust, we all took a more balanced view of technology hiring. Companies needed good technology people, and they were able to recruit them pretty easily or augment their teams offshore.<br>
<br>
Enter the 2010s. With cloud, mobility, big data and consumerization, companies are in even greater need of technology talent than they were in the late 1990s, and that talent is in even shorter supply. Computer science enrollments are at an all-time low; baby boomer workers are retiring and taking all of that legacy-systems knowledge with them; and Silicon Valley is hot again. Would that young, brilliant developer rather join the next Zynga or upgrade the payroll systems at your insurance company?<br>
<br>
The major talent problem today is not recruiting or developing leaders or retaining the existing talent but how to give business skills to the young technologists. These "Net Geners" or "Millenials" or "Generation Y people" or "facebookers" are so narrowly focused on the technology that they fail to see the forest through the trees. They do not understand the business context of their technology work. Those beautifully "blended executives," who can talk technology in one meeting and can talk business in another, are rare birds. Yet with technology moving directly into the revenue stream of your company, you need them, and your need is only going to increase. Here are some ideas to increase the rare birds in your organization:<br>
<br>
(1) Encourage your head of human resources to work with your CIO and a few of your other business leaders to build a program that rotates IT people into different functions of the business. This kind of program is not easy, with your CIO having to survive without a trusted IT leader for a period of time, but the long-term result of a good rotational program can be tremendous.<br>
<br>
(2) If a rotational program is too much to take on right now, build a leaderships development program for IT that involves your business executives. Encourage your CIO to invite the heads of your major business units to meet regularly with the senior IT team to educate them on their business area. And be sure that you, the CFO, are spending enough time with IT.<br>
<br>
(3) Embed your IT people in the business. By now, your CIO should have restructured that IT organisation so that each major business or functional area has a dedicated IT leader. These positions are called ''business relationship executive'', portfolio CIOs, or customer relationship managers and they often report both to the CIO and to a more valuable they become to you over time.<br>
<br>
(4) If a embedded structure is currently beyond your reach, start with a ''buddy system'' where each major IT leader has a partner on the business side. Your head of IT operations can buddy up with your head of sales. They sit on each other's meetings, get to know each other's organisations, and learn the major drivers - and challenges - of each other's areas of responsibility.<br>

Choose the best answer to each question.<br>
<br>
Way back in 2000, we had the "technology workforce crisis". The big issue was the cap that the U.S. government had put on H-1B visas and the strong need that companies had for developers and other technologists.<br>
Then along came the dot-com bust, and the news was all about layoffs and identifying the real goats in the Internet debacle. As the economy recovered from the bust, we all took a more balanced view of technology hiring. Companies needed good technology people, and they were able to recruit them pretty easily or augment their teams offshore.<br>
<br>
Enter the 2010s. With cloud, mobility, big data and consumerization, companies are in even greater need of technology talent than they were in the late 1990s, and that talent is in even shorter supply. Computer science enrollments are at an all-time low; baby boomer workers are retiring and taking all of that legacy-systems knowledge with them; and Silicon Valley is hot again. Would that young, brilliant developer rather join the next Zynga or upgrade the payroll systems at your insurance company?<br>
<br>
The major talent problem today is not recruiting or developing leaders or retaining the existing talent but how to give business skills to the young technologists. These "Net Geners" or "Millenials" or "Generation Y people" or "facebookers" are so narrowly focused on the technology that they fail to see the forest through the trees. They do not understand the business context of their technology work. Those beautifully "blended executives," who can talk technology in one meeting and can talk business in another, are rare birds. Yet with technology moving directly into the revenue stream of your company, you need them, and your need is only going to increase. Here are some ideas to increase the rare birds in your organization:<br>
<br>
(1) Encourage your head of human resources to work with your CIO and a few of your other business leaders to build a program that rotates IT people into different functions of the business. This kind of program is not easy, with your CIO having to survive without a trusted IT leader for a period of time, but the long-term result of a good rotational program can be tremendous.<br>
<br>
(2) If a rotational program is too much to take on right now, build a leaderships development program for IT that involves your business executives. Encourage your CIO to invite the heads of your major business units to meet regularly with the senior IT team to educate them on their business area. And be sure that you, the CFO, are spending enough time with IT.<br>
<br>
(3) Embed your IT people in the business. By now, your CIO should have restructured that IT organisation so that each major business or functional area has a dedicated IT leader. These positions are called ''business relationship executive'', portfolio CIOs, or customer relationship managers and they often report both to the CIO and to a more valuable they become to you over time.<br>
<br>
(4) If a embedded structure is currently beyond your reach, start with a ''buddy system'' where each major IT leader has a partner on the business side. Your head of IT operations can buddy up with your head of sales. They sit on each other's meetings, get to know each other's organisations, and learn the major drivers - and challenges - of each other's areas of responsibility.<br>
<br>
Getting technologists to be better at "business" is to fight the natural order of things and this will help you develop a new high-value generation of blended executives. Now, all you need to do is retain them.</p>

Blended executives are people who would see the forest through the trees i.e. envision the bigger picture and see the "Whole" in the "part".

Hence choice B is not the answer.</div><div>Option C: Refer to para 3. ''These people are so narrowly focused on the technology that they fail to see the forest through the trees.

With cloud, mobility, big data and consumerization, companies are in even greater need of technology talent than they were in the late 1990s, and that talent is in even shorter supply. Computer science enrollments are at an all-time low; baby boomer workers are retiring and taking all of that legacy-systems knowledge with them; and Silicon Valley is hot again. Would that young, brilliant developer rather join the next Zynga or upgrade the payroll systems at your insurance company?<br>
<br>
The major talent problem today is not recruiting or developing leaders or retaining the existing talent but how to give business skills to the young technologists. These "Net Geners" or "Millenials" or "Generation Y people" or "facebookers" are so narrowly focused on the technology that they fail to see the forest through the trees. They do not understand the business context of their technology work. Those beautifully "blended executives," who can talk technology in one meeting and can talk business in another, are rare birds. Yet with technology moving directly into the revenue stream of your company, you need them, and your need is only going to increase. Here are some ideas to increase the rare birds in your organization:<br>
<br>
(1) Encourage your head of human resources to work with your CIO and a few of your other business leaders to build a program that rotates IT people into different functions of the business. This kind of program is not easy, with your CIO having to survive without a trusted IT leader for a period of time, but the long-term result of a good rotational program can be tremendous.<br>
<br>
(2) If a rotational program is too much to take on right now, build a leaderships development program for IT that involves your business executives. Encourage your CIO to invite the heads of your major business units to meet regularly with the senior IT team to educate them on their business area. And be sure that you, the CFO, are spending enough time with IT.<br>
<br>
(3) Embed your IT people in the business. By now, your CIO should have restructured that IT organisation so that each major business or functional area has a dedicated IT leader. These positions are called ''business relationship executive'', portfolio CIOs, or customer relationship managers and they often report both to the CIO and to a more valuable they become to you over time.<br>
<br>
(4) If a embedded structure is currently beyond your reach, start with a ''buddy system'' where each major IT leader has a partner on the business side. Your head of IT operations can buddy up with your head of sales. They sit on each other's meetings, get to know each other's organisations, and learn the major drivers - and challenges - of each other's areas of responsibility.<br>
<br>
Getting technologists to be better at "business" is to fight the natural order of things and this will help you develop a new high-value generation of blended executives. Now, all you need to do is retain them.</p>

The ball point pen is, after all, just a use-and-throw product like any other, they'll contend. That's precisely the point. It is an easily replaceable product. When it stops functioning, you no longer run out to buy a refill – you simply throw it away and replace it with another. If you misplace one, it's hardly worth your while rummaging through your desk looking for it. A much simpler solution is to borrow one from your colleague – who never expects to get it back.<br><br>What makes the ballpoint pen special in the Indian context is the fact that until its advent in the form of the cheap plastic models that flooded the market in the early 90s, 'Disposability' as a concept was both alien and an anathema to the Indian consumer. Most marketers grappled with the fact that the Indian consumer continued to use products long after they were out of vogue. Forget that most Indian households had made a fine art out of recycling Amulspray, Farex and Dalda tins, using them for storage. Says AP Arora, professor of marketing at MDL, Gurgaon, who has been talking of the ballpoint pen's impact on marketing in India ever since the mid-1990s when he was a professor at IIM-Calcutta. “No one ever said that the ballpoint pen should be thrown away. But thanks to its low price and easy availability, it just became one of the first disposable products”.<br><br>Today, disposability is here to stay. Be it mobile phones, cars, TV sets or apparel, the upwardly mobile Indian is constantly disposing of the old and trading up for newer products. For instance, up to three years ago, the replacement cycle for TVs and washing machines was eight to 10 years - today, that figure is down to four to five years. And in the case of DVD players, it's even as low as two years, reveals Vivek Sharma, VP - Marketing &amp; Sales, MIRC Electronics. “Because DVDs are so cheap, it's easier to replace them. The incremental saving through servicing is not worth it for many.” Longevity isn't necessarily a desirable virtue for Indians, and increasingly, as products and brands become a mirror of self-image, consumers are replacing and upgrading faster than ever before. As Aniruddha Deshmukh, President – Retail, Raymond, points out, in apparel, party wear and casual wear sees a high velocity of change. “Youth fashion, uniqueness and contemporariness are expressions of the self and drive disposability. Formal wear, by its 'official' construct, has greater longevity.”<br><br>So what has led to this change? Santosh Desai, CEO, Future Brands, theorises that the 'mindset of scarcity' that once existed – thanks largely to the socialistic leaning that India as a nation had – is now giving way to consumerism. Post-liberalisation, there has been a slow but steady redefinition of the term 'value', which in turn has led to Indians warming up to the concept of disposability. He says, “Earlier, anything that was material had value, hence it was never disposed of, be it containers or durables. Today, materiality is no longer as imposing, and in a sense the immortal object has become mortal”. One of the reasons for the onset of this mortality was the choice paradigm that was ushered in thanks to liberalisation. Partha Sinha, Chief Strategy Officer, Publicis India, terms the pre-liberalisation era as one where the entire nation was bound by a “frugality code”. He points out that in those days consumers had little or no choice when it came to products, which were anyway never easily available. “That code is dying today. While we still are not a use-and-throw country, certain sections have definitely become a use-and-replace nation. So, disposability is more and more prevalent.”<br><br>No category represents the sway of disposability better than mobile phones. Hardly anyone could have imagined that Indian consumers would be willing to replace a perfectly functioning gadget within a year of purchase simply because a newer flashier model with more features was available. But that's reality as mobile phone companies are busy cranking out newer models. Devinder Kishore, Director –Marketing, Nokia India, points out that three years ago, the mobile handset industry as a whole launched less than 20 models in India in a year. “Now you have anywhere between 35-40 models being introduced in one half,” he says. Pranesh Misra, COO, Lowe, agrees that a lot of this has to do with supply – a constant flow of newer and edgier products – propelling consumers into trading up constantly.<br><br>However, the consensus is that disposability in the Indian context cannot be construed as use-and-throw in the traditional sense. Few Indians just throw away their old TV sets. Most, for example, will exchange theirs for better TVs or try and get a rebate on the next TV they buy.</div></div><div id="Language_Skills" class="question-details-Language-skill"><b>Type:&nbsp;</b> MCQ Single &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Marks:&nbsp;</b>  +1/-0.25 &nbsp;&nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Topic:&nbsp;</b> Verbal &gt; Reading Comprehension  &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Time Spent:&nbsp;</b><div>0 Mins 0 Secs</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-paper-number">13.&nbsp; </div> <div class="question-paper-question-text"> The mind set of the Indian consumer differs from that of his western contemporaries in</div></div><div class="question-paper-options"><div class="question-paper-option">A.&nbsp; expecting value for money. </div><div class="question-paper-option">B.&nbsp;re-using products till they are fully worn out.</div><div class="question-paper-option">C.&nbsp;extracting their money's worth from products.</div><div class="question-paper-option">D.&nbsp;expecting some value even from items he/she is ready to dispose. </div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-status-solution">Status : &nbsp;<div class="unanswered-answer">Unanswered</div></div></div><div class="question-paper-text-actual-solution"><b>Answer :  D</b></div><div class="solution"><div data-accordion-component="Accordion" class="accordion"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItem" class="accordion__item"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemHeading" role="heading" class="accordion__heading" aria-level="3"><div id="accordion__heading-12" aria-disabled="false" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accordion__panel-12" role="button" tabindex="0" class="accordion__button" data-accordion-component="AccordionItemButton">View Solution</div></div><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemPanel" class="accordion__panel" role="region" aria-labelledby="accordion__heading-12" id="accordion__panel-12" hidden="">Refer to para 2, sentences 2 and 3, and para 4, sentence 4.</div></div></div></div><div class="bookmark-question"><button class="bookmark-button Button__StyledButton-sc-1o41kgk-0 hHWAHx" spacing="default" type="button"><span style="align-self: center; display: inline-flex; flex-wrap: nowrap; max-width: 100%; position: relative;"><span style="align-items: center; align-self: center; flex: 1 1 auto; margin: 0px 4px; max-width: 100%; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; transition: opacity 0.3s ease 0s; opacity: 1;"><span class="sc-iQKALj jOPeQg"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation"><path d="M12 16.373l3.98 2.193-.76-4.655 3.276-3.347-4.524-.69L12 5.687l-1.972 4.189-4.524.689L8.78 13.91l-.762 4.655L12 16.373zm0 2.283l-3.016 1.662a2 2 0 0 1-2.939-2.075l.599-3.656-2.57-2.624a2 2 0 0 1 1.129-3.377l3.47-.528 1.518-3.224a2 2 0 0 1 3.618 0l1.519 3.224 3.47.528a2 2 0 0 1 1.127 3.377l-2.569 2.624.599 3.656a2 2 0 0 1-2.94 2.075L12 18.656z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></span>Bookmark</span></span></button><button class="bookmark-button Button__StyledButton-sc-1o41kgk-0 hHWAHx" spacing="default" type="button"><span style="align-self: center; display: inline-flex; flex-wrap: nowrap; max-width: 100%; position: relative;"><span style="align-items: center; align-self: center; flex: 1 1 auto; margin: 0px 4px; max-width: 100%; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; transition: opacity 0.3s ease 0s; opacity: 1;"><span class="sc-iQKALj jOPeQg"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation"><path d="M6 12.235v6.446c0 .537.45.977 1 .977s1-.44 1-.977v-5.778c1.17-.341 2.389-.045 3.768.29.982.238 2.036.495 3.13.495a5.73 5.73 0 0 0 2.547-.567 1 1 0 0 0 .563-.9V5.466a.998.998 0 0 0-1.437-.9c-1.345.654-2.731.317-4.331-.071-1.729-.42-3.687-.895-5.678.072A1 1 0 0 0 6 5.466v6.769zm3.111-1.48c1.094 0 2.148.256 3.129.495 1.381.335 2.6.63 3.768.289V6.836c-1.488.27-2.93-.08-4.24-.398-1.379-.335-2.598-.632-3.768-.29v4.704a6.195 6.195 0 0 1 1.111-.097z" fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></span> Share question feedback</span></span></button></div><hr></div><div class="question-div-paper"><div class="passage-details"><div class="passage-header"><b> Passage :</b></div><div class="passage-header"><strong>Directions for questions:</strong> Read the following passage carefully and select the best answer for questions that follow it.<br><br><strong>F</strong>ew marketers, if any, are likely to acknowledge the humble ball point pen as the harbinger of a socio-cultural revolution that has transformed the way they do business in India.

The ball point pen is, after all, just a use-and-throw product like any other, they'll contend. That's precisely the point. It is an easily replaceable product. When it stops functioning, you no longer run out to buy a refill – you simply throw it away and replace it with another. If you misplace one, it's hardly worth your while rummaging through your desk looking for it. A much simpler solution is to borrow one from your colleague – who never expects to get it back.<br><br>What makes the ballpoint pen special in the Indian context is the fact that until its advent in the form of the cheap plastic models that flooded the market in the early 90s, 'Disposability' as a concept was both alien and an anathema to the Indian consumer. Most marketers grappled with the fact that the Indian consumer continued to use products long after they were out of vogue. Forget that most Indian households had made a fine art out of recycling Amulspray, Farex and Dalda tins, using them for storage. Says AP Arora, professor of marketing at MDL, Gurgaon, who has been talking of the ballpoint pen's impact on marketing in India ever since the mid-1990s when he was a professor at IIM-Calcutta. “No one ever said that the ballpoint pen should be thrown away. But thanks to its low price and easy availability, it just became one of the first disposable products”.<br><br>Today, disposability is here to stay. Be it mobile phones, cars, TV sets or apparel, the upwardly mobile Indian is constantly disposing of the old and trading up for newer products. For instance, up to three years ago, the replacement cycle for TVs and washing machines was eight to 10 years - today, that figure is down to four to five years. And in the case of DVD players, it's even as low as two years, reveals Vivek Sharma, VP - Marketing &amp; Sales, MIRC Electronics. “Because DVDs are so cheap, it's easier to replace them. The incremental saving through servicing is not worth it for many.” Longevity isn't necessarily a desirable virtue for Indians, and increasingly, as products and brands become a mirror of self-image, consumers are replacing and upgrading faster than ever before. As Aniruddha Deshmukh, President – Retail, Raymond, points out, in apparel, party wear and casual wear sees a high velocity of change. “Youth fashion, uniqueness and contemporariness are expressions of the self and drive disposability. Formal wear, by its 'official' construct, has greater longevity.”<br><br>So what has led to this change? Santosh Desai, CEO, Future Brands, theorises that the 'mindset of scarcity' that once existed – thanks largely to the socialistic leaning that India as a nation had – is now giving way to consumerism. Post-liberalisation, there has been a slow but steady redefinition of the term 'value', which in turn has led to Indians warming up to the concept of disposability. He says, “Earlier, anything that was material had value, hence it was never disposed of, be it containers or durables. Today, materiality is no longer as imposing, and in a sense the immortal object has become mortal”. One of the reasons for the onset of this mortality was the choice paradigm that was ushered in thanks to liberalisation. Partha Sinha, Chief Strategy Officer, Publicis India, terms the pre-liberalisation era as one where the entire nation was bound by a “frugality code”. He points out that in those days consumers had little or no choice when it came to products, which were anyway never easily available. “That code is dying today. While we still are not a use-and-throw country, certain sections have definitely become a use-and-replace nation. So, disposability is more and more prevalent.”<br><br>No category represents the sway of disposability better than mobile phones. Hardly anyone could have imagined that Indian consumers would be willing to replace a perfectly functioning gadget within a year of purchase simply because a newer flashier model with more features was available. But that's reality as mobile phone companies are busy cranking out newer models. Devinder Kishore, Director –Marketing, Nokia India, points out that three years ago, the mobile handset industry as a whole launched less than 20 models in India in a year. “Now you have anywhere between 35-40 models being introduced in one half,” he says. Pranesh Misra, COO, Lowe, agrees that a lot of this has to do with supply – a constant flow of newer and edgier products – propelling consumers into trading up constantly.<br><br>However, the consensus is that disposability in the Indian context cannot be construed as use-and-throw in the traditional sense. Few Indians just throw away their old TV sets. Most, for example, will exchange theirs for better TVs or try and get a rebate on the next TV they buy.</div></div><div id="Language_Skills" class="question-details-Language-skill"><b>Type:&nbsp;</b> MCQ Single &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Marks:&nbsp;</b>  +1/-0.25 &nbsp;&nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Topic:&nbsp;</b> Verbal &gt; Reading Comprehension  &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Time Spent:&nbsp;</b><div>0 Mins 0 Secs</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-paper-number">15.&nbsp; </div> <div class="question-paper-question-text">The mobile phone marks a turning point in the attractions of disposability because it is a category where</div></div><div class="question-paper-options"><div class="question-paper-option">A.&nbsp;a functioning product is replaced by newer ones with more features.</div><div class="question-paper-option">B.&nbsp;the greatest number of models are available.</div><div class="question-paper-option">C.&nbsp;obsolescence is the most prevalent.</div><div class="question-paper-option">D.&nbsp;the relationship that people have with products is transient.</div></div><div class="question-paper-text"><div class="question-status-solution">Status : &nbsp;<div class="unanswered-answer">Unanswered</div></div></div><div class="question-paper-text-actual-solution"><b>Answer :  C</b></div><div class="solution"><div data-accordion-component="Accordion" class="accordion"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItem" class="accordion__item"><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemHeading" role="heading" class="accordion__heading" aria-level="3"><div id="accordion__heading-14" aria-disabled="false" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accordion__panel-14" role="button" tabindex="0" class="accordion__button" data-accordion-component="AccordionItemButton">View Solution</div></div><div data-accordion-component="AccordionItemPanel" class="accordion__panel" role="region" aria-labelledby="accordion__heading-14" id="accordion__panel-14" hidden="">Refer to para 5.

<p>Good Vibes has been launched for deafblind to enable them to have two-way communication with their caregivers, family and friends. Good Vibes app uses Morse code, which converts vibrations (a combination of dots and dashes that the deafblind can interpret) into text or voice (on the caregiver’s app) and vice-versa. 'Relumino' is a visual aid application for people with low vision to help them see images clearer by magnifying and minimizing images, highlighting the image outline, adjusting colour contrast and brightness, and reversing colour. National Association for the Blind (NAB) will use Relumino in classrooms where students with low vision will use these devices to see better, thus, helping them improve their learning abilities.</p>
